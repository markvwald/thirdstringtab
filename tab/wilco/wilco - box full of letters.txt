D          A           G       Em                       G
I've got a box full of letters, think you might like to read
D    A          G                             Em                G
Some things you might like to see, but they're all addressed to me
D        A            G      Em                               G
I wish I had a lot of answers 'cause that's the way it should be
D        A         G        Em                 G
But with all these questions being directed at me

       D              A                G                         D
I just can't find the time to write my mind the way I want it to read

A           D          G  F#  A
You'll come back again
               D          G  F#  A
And I'll still be your friend

D       A           G      Em             G
I got a lot of your records in a separate stack
D   A        G             Em          G
Somethings I might like to hear, but I guess I'll give 'em back
D        A            G      Em                               G
I wish I had a lot of answers 'cause that's the way it should be
D        A         G        Em                 G
But with all these questions being directed at me

       D              A                G                         D
I just can't find the time to write my mind the way I want it to read

A           D          G  F#  A
You'll come back again
               D          G  F#  A
And I'll still be your friend
