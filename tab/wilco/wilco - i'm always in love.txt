Why, I wonder, is my heart full of holes?
        B                   E                  B E
And the feeling goes but my hair keeps growing
       B       E  D#m   C#m         F#
Will I set the sun on a big-wheeled wagon?
C#m         E              B     E B E
I'm bragging I'm always in love

     B                E                    B E
When I let go of your throat-sweet throttle
       B                      E               B E
When I clean the lash of your black-belt model
       B         E   D#m     C#m       F#
Will I catch the moon like a bird in a cage?
C#m            E                    B        E B E
It's for you I swoon, I'm always in love

F#                   E
I don't get the connection, If this is only a test
C#m               E
I hope I do my best, You know I won't forget

       B                   E           B E
When I fold the cold in my jet-lag palm
       B                 E            B E
When I soak so long I forget my mother
       B       E  D#m   C#m         F#
Will I set the sun on a big-wheeled wagon?

It's a drag I snag, I'm always in love
