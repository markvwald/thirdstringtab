Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
G
Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm, maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm

Something in my veins, bloodier than blood, something in my veins, bloodier than blood

You've changed, oh you've changed

D
What you once were isn't what you want to be anymore
