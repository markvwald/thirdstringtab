intro
Bb      Eb      Dm      F(I)
Eb      Bb      Gm      F    Eb

Bb               Eb
Some time as a much older man
        Dm                      F(I)
I will sit down and put on this song
Eb                     Bb
It just might make me cry,
        Gm      F             Eb
Or at the very least a tear in my eye

Bb                      Eb
I can't take all these years of my life
        Dm                  F(I)
To be whittled down into a thought
Eb                        Bb
That only appears to the year
        Gm       F      Eb
I made memories perfectly clear

Bb     Eb   Dm   F(I)
Mama, mama,
Eb     Bb   Gm   F  Eb
Mama, mama

Bb               Eb
I just want to be making my mind,
          Dm                      F(I)
Keep from changing my mind not to change
Eb                      Bb
Cause I'm greedy as the sea,
           Gm      F      Eb
And that's how it always will be

Bb                                Eb
I'll be somebody now, and I'll be somebody then,
            Dm                 F(I)
And I'll be all of you all in between
Eb                         Bb
And then I'll be ready to leave
         Gm             F      Eb
When the whole world is taken with me

Bb     Eb   Dm   F(I)
Mama, mama,
Eb     Bb   Gm   F  Eb
Mama, mama

               Cm                 F
Cause there're so many days in a year
            Cm                    F
And there's so many years in my head
        Eb                      Bb
So I think about when I'll be dead,
        Eb                            Bb
And how those very last moments get spent
           Eb                                                F(I)
And if I think about you is that something you think you'd accept?

Bb               Eb
Some time as a much older man
        Dm                      F(I)
I will sit down and put on this song
Eb                     Bb
It just might make me cry,
        Gm      F             Eb
Or at the very least a tear in my eye.
