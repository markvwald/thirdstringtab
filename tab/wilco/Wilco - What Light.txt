    D                                     G
you feel like singing a song and you want other people to sing along
         D             A               G               D
you just sing what you feel, don't let anyone say it's wrong
              D                                        G
and if you're trying to paint a picture but you're not sure which colors belong
     D              A              G               D
just paint what you see, don't let anyone say it's wrong
              G                     A
and if you're strung out like a kite or stone awake in the night
G
it's alright to be frightened

              D           G                    D           G
and there's a light, what light. and there's a light, what light
              D            G               Bb  C
and there's a light, white light inside of you

           D                                         G
and if you think you might need somebody to pick you up when you drag
      D                 A               G                  D
don't lose sight of yourself, don't let anyone change your bite
           D                                                G
and if the whole world's singing your songs and all of your paintings have been hung
       D               A        G                   D
just remember what was yours is everyone's from now on
G                                          A
and that's not wrong or right, but you can struggle with it all you like
G
you'll only get uptight

              D           G                    D           G
and there's a light, what light. and there's a light, what light
              D            G                    D            G
and there's a light, white light. and there's a light, white light

              D          G                    D            G
and there's a light, one light. and there's a light, white light
              D          G                    D            G
and there's a light, one light. and there's a light, white light

              D          G                    D          G
