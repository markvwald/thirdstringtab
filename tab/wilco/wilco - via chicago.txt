I dreamed about killing you again last night and it felt alright to me
C                          G                      F
Dying on the banks of Embarcadero skies, I sat and watched you bleed
C                          G                      F
Buried you alive in a fireworks display, raining down on me
    C                    G                  F
You cold, hot blood ran away from me to the sea

I painted my name on the back of a leaf and I watched it float away
    C                        G                            F
The hope I had in a notebook full of white, dry pages was all I tried to save
        C                 G                  F
But the wind blew me back via Chicago in the middle of the night
    C                        G                      F
And all without fight at the crush of veils and starlight

I know I'll make it back one of these days and turn on your TV
C                     G                    F
To watch a man with a face like mine being chased down a busy street
C                      G                F
When he gets caught, I won't get up and I won't go to sleep
C               G                F
I'm coming home, I'm coming home via Chicago

C                                      G                  F
Where the cups are cracked and hooked above the sink they make me think
C                            G                          F
Crumbling ladder tears don't fall, they shine down your shoulders
    C                        G                    F
And crawling is screw faster lash, I blow it with kisses
C                   G                  F
I rest my head on a pillowy star and a cracked door moon
That says I haven't gone too far

C               G                F
I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home, Via Chicago
C               G                F
I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
C                    G                     F
Searching for a home, searching for a home, searching for a home Via Chicago
C               G                F
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
