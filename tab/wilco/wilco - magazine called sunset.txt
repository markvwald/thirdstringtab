          D               G            Bm                E
There's a magazine called sunset and a tape machine that won't let
   G                  Bb                   D   A7
me ever forget this impossible longing for you

Let's take a map across your pillow and breathe the sky in through your window
     G                                            D  A7
I'll stay in the riddle and watch your books cave in

Aww maybe your my inspiration, just lead me to some new sensation
     G                                   D   A7
I'll make a little guide we can call our own

                D               G            Bm                E
Cause there's a magazine called sunset and a tape machine that won't let
   G                  Bb                   D   A7
me ever forget this impossible longing for you
