It's just a bad movie, where there's no crying
            D     G            D   A
handing the key to me in this Red Lion,
          G             D             G                  D   A     A Asus4 Asus4
where the lock that you locked in the suite says there's no prying
        G               D              G                       D   A        A Asus4 Asus4
When the breath that you breathed in the street screams there's no science
         G           D              G          D     A      A Asus4
When you look how you looked then to me, then I cease lying
          G D G D Dsus2 A Asus4 Asus4
and fall into silence

           D    G                 D    A      A Asus4 Asus4
It's just a life story, so there's no climax
            D   G              D        A    A Asus4 Asus4
No more new territory, so pull away the imax
        G             D                  G              D  A       A Asus4 Asus4
In the slot that you sliced through the scene there was no shyness
        G            D                   G               D  A
In the plot that you passed through your teeth there was no pity
            G      D         G          D    A    Asus4
No fade in: film begins on a kid in the big city
       G        D        G                D   A      A Asus4 Asus4
And no cut to a costly parade (that's for him only!)
      G           D         G               D    A    A Asus4 Asus4
No dissolve to a sliver of grey (that's his new lady!)
          G               D               G                   D      A
where she glows just like grain on the flickering pane of some great movie

Hey I'd watch it!

It's just a house burning, but it's not haunted
           D      G                D    A
It was your heart hurting, but not for long, kid
        G          D              G            D   A        A Asus4 Asus4
In the socket you spin from with ease there is no sticking
           G            D           G         D      A        A Asus4 Asus4
From the speakers your fake masterpiece comes serenely dribbling
          G              D               G                 D      A      A Asus4 Asus4
When the air round your chair fills with heat, that's the flames licking
             G            D           G                 D    A         A Asus4 Asus4
beneath the clock on the clean mantelpiece. It's got a calm clicking,
        G          D       G               D     A          Asus4            G     D
like a pro at his editing suite takes two weeks stitching        up some bad movie
