                     A    F#m
I'm coming into your town
E                          A
Night is falling to the ground,
F#m             E                       D
but I can still see where you loved yourself
           A            E           D
before he tore it all down. April 12th,
      A             E              D
with nobody else around; you were outside the house
              E          F#m
where's your mother?
E                         A   F#m
when he put you in the car,
E                            A
when he took you down the road
F#m                E                D
And I can still see where it was open,
      A                             D
the door he slammed closed. It was open,
      A                             D           E
the door he slammed closed. It was open, long ago

      A             E                 F#m
But don't lose me now, don't lose me now
               D                   A
Though I know that I'm not useful anyhow,
F#m                  E
just let me stick around
        A               E
while I tell you, like before,
            F#m             D                 A
you should say his name the way that he said yours
              F#m                   E
But you don't want to say his name anymore. Oh, Cynda Moore

Baby daughter on the road,
F#m   E                              A
you're wrapped up warm in daddy's coat
F#m                E                   D
And I can still see the cigarette's heat
          A                             D
I can't believe all that you're telling me,
         A                                   D
what is cutting like the smoke through your teeth
                       E
as you're telling me "forget it."

F#m  E                          A
But if I could tear his throat,
F#m  E                           A
and spill his blood between my jaws,
  F#m                       E
and erase his name out for good,
                       D
don't you know that I would?
                        A
Don't you realize that I wouldn't pause,
        D             A
that I would cut him down with my claws
      D                                 E
if I could have somehow never let that happen?

        A                   E
Or I'd call, some black midnight,
            F#m                  D                  A
fuck up his new life where they don't know what he did,
          F#m                    E
tell his brand-new wife and his second kid
          A               E
Though I tell you, like before,
                 F#m                D                  A
you should wreck his life the way that he wrecked yours,
         F#m                     E
you want no part of his life anymore. Oh Cynda Moore,

A              E                  F#m
don't lose me now, let me help you out
               D                 A
Though I know that I can't help anyhow,
F#m                   E
when I watch you I'm proud
        A               E
When I tell you twice before
                 F#m                D                   A
that you should wreck his life the way that he wrecked yours,
         F#m                 E
you want no part of his life anymore
         D     A     E
oh Cynda Mo  -  o  -  ore
           D            A          E
It'll never be the way it was before,
       D                   A                   E
but I wish that you would let me through that door
D    A    E
Right through that door
D    A    E
Right through that door
D    A    E
Right through that door
