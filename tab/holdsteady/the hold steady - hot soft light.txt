I was not involved up at the Northtown mall
As a matter of fact i didn't even know that that's where it happened

I was France Ave when they came out dancing
I was Lyndale South. i was kicking it with cousins
We were talking about going clubbing but instead we just started drinking

I've been straight since the Cinco de Mayo. Before that i was blotto
I was blacked out. i was cracked out. I was caved in
You should have seen all these portals that i've powered up in

F#m             A       E               B
We started recreational. It ended kinda medical
   F#m                              A                         E  B
It came on hot and soft and then it tightened up its tentacles

I wasn't there. I was blind high. i was scared
I was lake and columbus. I was cutting off all my hair
I was unfurling a flag of defiance aimed at my guidance guy

So this is it. This is the end of the session
I ain't gonna be taking any more questions
I think my attorney's gonna second that notion
