i guess I met her at the party pit
G         G/F#           G/B   C
She said those kids she's with were selling it
G         G/F#           G/B   C
so we sailed off on some separate trips
G         G/F#           G/B   C
She got pinned down at the party pit

G         G/F#           G/B   C
I went away to school that fall
G         G/F#           G/B   C
She stuck around with all those stickpin dolls
G         G/F#           G/B   C
Sped through the scene until the engine stalled
G         G/F#           G/B   C
At some suburban shopping mall

I came back to start a band, of course
G         G/F#           G/B   C
saw her walking thru the crystal court
G         G/F#           G/B   C
she made a scene by the revolving doors
G         G/F#           G/B   C
she's gonna walk around and drink some more

G         G/F#           G/B   C
so we walked across that grain belt bridge
G         G/F#           G/B   C
into bright new minneapolis
G         G/F#           G/B   C
she said i think that all those things I did
G         G/F#           G/B   C
were just momentum from the party pit
