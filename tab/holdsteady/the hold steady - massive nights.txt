[main riff]
The guys were feeling good about their liquor run
The girls were kinda flirting with the setting sun
We all kinda fumbled thru the jitterbug
We were all powered up on some new upper drug

Everyone was funny and everyone was pretty
Everyone was coming towards the center of the city
The dance floor was crowded. The bathrooms were worse
We kissed in your car and we drank from your purse

I had my mouth on her nose when the
                                       E
chaperone said that we were dancing too close

[main riff]
We had some massive nights. (Whoa)
Every song was right. (Whoa)
All that wine was tight. (Whoa)
And your friends were pretty cool. (Whoa)
And my friends were acting cool

[main riff]
There weren't any fights
There's usually one or two
Some guys they get a little bit uptight
Some girls they got something to prove

We had some massive highs
We had some crushing lows
We had some lusty little crushes
We had those all ages hardcore matinee shows

G#m                   C#m
I was down on my knees when the
                                  E
chaperone said that it was time for me to leave.
