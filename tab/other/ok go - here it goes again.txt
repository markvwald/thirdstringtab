It could be ten, but then again, I can't remember
        Bb                      F
half an hour since a quarter to four
C                                 G
Throw on your clothes, the second side of Surfer Rosa
        Bb                          F
and you leave me with my jaw on the floor

Em                         Am
Just when you think you're in control
              Em                       Am
just when you think you've got a hold, just when you get on a roll

C         G             Bb            F
  here it goes, here it goes, here it goes again
Am    G             C
  Oh, here it goes again
              G                  Bb                 F
I should have known, should have known, should have known again
Am    G            G#                       C
  but here it goes again. Oh, here it goes again

C                             G
It starts out easy, something simple, something sleazy
          Bb                           F
something inching past the edge of reserve
C                        G
Now through lines of the cheap venetian blinds
            Bb                 F
your car is pulling off of the curb

C-G-Bb-F

Em                         Am
Just when you think you're in control
              Em                       Am
just when you think you've got a hold, just when you get on a roll

C         G             Bb            F
  here it goes, here it goes, here it goes again
Am    G             C
  Oh, here it goes again
              G                  Bb                 F
I should have known, should have known, should have known again
Am    G             C
  but here it goes again
           G    Bb          F
Ah here it goes, ah here it goes
Am      G           G# (hold)
  Oh, here it goes again

I guess there's got to be a break in the monotony
    Bb                          F
but Jesus, when it rains how it pours
C                                 G
Throw on your clothes, the second side of Surfer Rosa
        Bb                  F        (break)
and you leave me, yeah, you leave me

C         G             Bb            F
  here it goes, here it goes, here it goes again

I should have known,  I should have known
Am    G
