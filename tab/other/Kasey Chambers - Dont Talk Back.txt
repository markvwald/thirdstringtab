Capo IV

G Em C D x2
          Em                  C
Well it's half my heart and a little bit of soul
     G               D
That makes me feel I wanna ride this road
Em         C              G     D
I wouldn't change it if I could
    Em                               C
And me and this road, you know we've got an understanding
G                    D
It won't leave me at home and I am
Em           C              G          D
Too tired to do just what I should
C                D               G     G/F#    Em
And last night I asked if I could take comfort in the rosewood
C                        D
The road said nothing at all

          G                         Em
'Cause it don't talk back unless the wind blows hard
  C                           D
I drive it all night with the wheel of my car
G                 C               D
It won't leave me running for the door
           G                       Em
And if the paint's still wet I can just slow down
       C                    D
And it all goes away on the other side of town
G                   C       D
And nothing is that easy anymore

         Em                        C
Well the hurt won't leave with the sight of white lines
G                  D
But it eases up my pain for a while
Em       C            G     D
The only habit that I keep
Em                          C
And miles take time but the time is mine
    G             D
And always moving suits me fine
Em            C             G      D
I'll catch my breath when I sleep
C         D                 G        G/F#        Em
And after all that I've done I'm not half what I hoped that I'd become
C                           D
There's still a long way to go

          G                         Em
'Cause it don't talk back unless the wind blows hard
  C                           D

G                 C               D
It won't leave me running for the door
           G                       Em

       C                    D
