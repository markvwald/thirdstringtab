G                D           C              G
  Hanging on the promises in songs of yesterday
Am                    D     Am                          D
  And I've made up my mind...   I ain't wasting no more time
           Em   Am  G             Em  Am C D
here I go again...     here I go again

  Though I keep searching for an answer...   I never seem to find what I'm looking for

  'cause I know what it means to walk along the lonely streets of dreams
  
    G          C          D   C  D
And here I go again on my own
      G             C              D    C  D
going down the only road I've ever known
       G             C            D     C   
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
Am7                   D     Am7                         D    C  D

  I'm just another heart in need of rescue...   waiting on love's sweet charity
G               D               C          G
  And I'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days
