Her name is Noelle, I have a dream about her
E            B              E            A
She rings my bell, I've got gym class in half an hour
E          B        E            A
Oh how she rocks in Keds in tube socks
    C#m         A          B
But she doesn't know who I am
    C#m         A      B
And she doesn't give a damn about me

      E          A       B       C#m  G#m
Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby

Her boyfriend's a dick. He brings a gun to school
    E           B       E         A
And he'd simply kick my ass if he knew the truth
   E           B            E          A
He lives on my block and he drives an Iroc
    C#m        A          B
But he doesn't know who I am
    C#m        A      B

Man I feel like mold. It's Prom night and I am lonely
E        B     E             A
Lo and behold, she's walking over to me
E            B        E             A
This must be fake. My lip starts to shake
C#m          A          B
