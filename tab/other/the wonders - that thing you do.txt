E      A           B        E
You    doin' that thing you do
       A           B       C#m          F#
You're breakin' my heart into a million pieces
F#m             Am  B
Like you always do

     E          A         B       E
And you    you don't mean to be cruel
 A     B   C#m             F#
You never even knew about the heartache
 D                 B
I've been goin' through

        C#m               F#
Well, I try and try to forget you, girl
           E      E7     A   Am
But it's just so hard to do
 E             Am                E     B
Every time you do that thing you do

E      A           B       E
I    know all the games you play
         A           B     C#m            F#
And I'm gonna find a way to let you know that
F#m             Am  B
You'll be mine some day

     E          A         B       E
'Cause we    could be happy can't you see
 A     B   C#m             F#
If you'd only let me be the one to hold you
 D                 B
And keep you here with me

        C#m               F#
Well, I try and try to forget you, girl
           E      E7     A   Am
But it's just so hard to do
 E             Am                E
Every time you do that thing you do


A
I don't ask a lot, girl (I don't ask a lot, girl)
      C#m
But I know one thing's for sure (know one thing's for sure)
           F#
It's your love I haven't got, girl
       B                  C       B
And I just can't take it anymore     (Wow!)

'Cause it hurts me so just to see you go
   E         E7      A    Am
Around with someone new
       E                  Am
And if I know you you're doin' that thing

 E              Am
Every day just doin' that thing
E                 B                   A
I can't take you doin' that thing you do
