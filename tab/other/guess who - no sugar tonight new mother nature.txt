No sugar tonight in my coffee, no sugar tonight in my tea

No sugar to stand beside me, no sugar to run with me

In the silence of her mind, quiet movements where I can find
Grabbing for me with her eyes, now I'm falling from her skies

Jocko says yes and I believe him, when we talk about the things I say
She hasn't got the faith or the guts to leave him when they're standing in each other's way
You're tripping back now to places you've been to, you wonder what you're gonna find
You know you've been wrong but it won't be long before you leave 'em all far behind

                G [B]                    D [F#]         G [B]                     D [F#]
'Cause it's the new mother nature taking over, It's the new splendid lady come to call

Jocko said no when I came back last time, it's looking like I lost a friend
No use calling 'cause the sky is falling and I'm getting pretty near the end
A smoke-filled room in a corner basement, the situation must be right
A bag of goodies and a bottle of wine, we're gonna get it on right tonight

                G [B]                    D [F#]         G [B]                     D [F#]
