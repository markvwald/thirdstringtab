I met her in a club down in old Soho where they
A                      D                       E             A
drink champagne and it tastes just like cherry cola, C-O-L-A cola

    E
she walked up to me and she asked me to dance
  A                           D
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said
E             A    D             C      D  E
Lola  L-O-L-A Lola   La la la la Lola

      E
Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy
             A                             D
but when she squeezed me tight, she nearly broke my spine
      E                 A
oh my Lola  La la la la Lola
     E
well i'm not drunk but I can't understand
        A                      D
why she walks like a woman and talks like a man
      E             A    D             C      D  E
oh my Lola  L-O-L-A Lola   La la la la Lola

Well we drank champagne and danced all night under electric candle light
    A
She picked me up and sat me on her knee and said "dear boy won't you come home with me?"

      E
Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy
           A                          D
but when I looked in her eyes, well I almost fell for my
E                 A    D             C      D
Lola  La la la la Lola   La la la la Lola
E                 A    D             C     D E
Lola  La la la la Lola   La la la la Lola

  A      E    B      A      E      B
I pushed her away, I walked to the door
  A    E      B            E    G#7   C#m
I fell to the floor, I got down on my knees
     B
Then I looked at her and she at me

     E
Well that's the way that I want it to stay
      A                   D
And I always wanted it to be that way
       E             A     D
For my Lola, L-O-L-A Lola
E
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
       A                    D
It's a mixed up, muddled up shook up world
           E                 A
Except for Lola, La-la-la-la Lola

       B7                               F#7
Well I left home just a week before and I'd never ever kissed a woman before
    A
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand and said dear boy I'm gonna make you a man

     E
Well I'm not the world's most masculine man
      A                      D
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
          E                 A   D            C     D
And so is Lola, La-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
E                A   D            C     D  E
Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
