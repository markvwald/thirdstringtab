                         B
Well I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
           E                             B
I know not everybody has got a body like you
                      B
But I've got to think twice before I give my heart away
           E                                          B
And I know all the games you play because I play them too

         E                       B
Oh but I need some time off from that emotion
E                                B
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
                 E                   B     G#m
Oh and when that love comes down without devotion
        E                                                F#
Well it takes a strong man baby, but I'm showing you the door

                    B
‘Cause I gotta have faith, I gotta have faith
‘Cause I gotta have faith, faith
‘Cause I gotta have faith, faith, faith

  B
Baby, I know you're asking me to stay
                    E                                                B
Say please, please, please don't go away, you say I'm giving you the blues
B
Maybe you mean every word you say
               E                                  B
Can't help but think of yesterday and another who tied me down to loverboy rules

  E                 B
Before this river becomes an ocean
  E                                   B
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
             E             B       G#m
Oh oh baby I reconsider my foolish notion
       E                                 F#
Well I need someone to hold me, but I'll wait for something more

                    B
Yes I've gotta have faith, mmm I gotta have faith
‘Cause I gotta have faith, faith, faith, I gotta have faith-a-faith-a-faith

  E                 B
Before this river becomes an ocean
  E                                   B
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
             E             B       G#m
Oh oh baby I reconsider my foolish notion
       E                                 F#
Well I need someone to hold me, but I'll wait for something more

                   B
Cause I gotta have faith, mmm I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith-a-faith-a-faith
I gotta have faith-a-faith-a-faith
