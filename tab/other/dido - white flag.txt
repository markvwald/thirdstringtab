F    Am

Dm                                                     Am
I know you think that I shouldn't still love you, I'll tell you that
       Dm                                            Am
But if I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it, where's the sense in that?
          C                                            Dm                    Am
I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder or return to where we were

Bb                            F                Gm                     Dm
Well I will go down with this ship and I won't put my hands up and surrender
              Bb                     F            C               Gm
There will be no white flag above my door, I'm in love and always will be

Dm                                                  Am
I know I left too much mess and destruction to come back again
             Dm                                             Am
And I caused nothing but trouble, I understand if you can't talk to me again
           C                                        Dm                         Am
And if you live by the rules of it's over, then I'm sure that that makes sense

Bb                            F                Gm                     Dm
Well I will go down with this ship and I won't put my hands up and surrender
              Bb                     F            C               Gm
There will be no white flag above my door, I'm in love and always will be

            F                                      Dm
And when we meet as I'm sure we will, all that was then will be there still
            Gm                                   C
I'll let it pass and hold my tongue and you will think that I've moved on

Bb                            F                Gm                     Dm
Well I will go down with this ship and I won't put my hands up and surrender
              Bb                     F            C               Gm
There will be no white flag above my door, I'm in love and always will be
Bb                            F                Gm                     Dm
Well I will go down with this ship and I won't put my hands up and surrender
              Bb                     F            C               Gm
There will be no white flag above my door, I'm in love and always will be
Bb                       F                Gm                     Dm
I will go down with this ship and I won't put my hands up and surrender
              Bb                     F            C               Gm
There will be no white flag above my door, I'm in love and always will be
