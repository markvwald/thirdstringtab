Games changes and fears, when will they go from here
               n/c                  D                   A
When will they stop, I believe that fate has brought us here
                    Em7
And we should be together babe, but we're not

  I play it off but I'm dreaming of you, I'll keep my cool but I'm fiendin'

                 D                             A
I try to say goodbye and I choke, try to walk away but I stumble

Though I try to hide it, it's clear, my world crumbles when you are not here
    D                             A
Goodbye and I choke, try to walk away and I stumble

Though I try to hide it, it's clear, my world crumbles when you are not here

D                   A                     Em             n/c
I may appear to be free, but I'm just a prisoner of your love
              D                        A
I may seem alright and smile when you leave
                   Em
But my smiles are just a front, just a front

G                       F#m7            Em7                        A
  I play it off but I'm dreaming of you, I'll keep my cool but I'm fiendin'

Goodbye and I choke, try to walk away and I stumble

Here is my confession, may I be your possession?
                Em7                          C7
Boy I need your touch, your love kisses and such
                    Bm7                      Em
With all my might I try, but this I can't deny... deny
