Low down leaving sun, I've done did everything that needs done
G7               D            E7                           A
Woe is me, why can't I see, I best be leaving well enough alone
     D                           D7
Them neon light nights, couldn't stay out of fights
D                          G
Keep a-haunting me and memories
         G7                      D
There is one in every crowd, for crying out loud
E7                        A
Why was it always turning out be me

D                     D7
Where does it go, the good Lord only knows
    D                               G
It seems like it was just the other day
      G7                    D
I was down at Green Gables, hawking them tables
    E7                       A
And generally blowing all my hard earned pay
  D                   D7
Piano rolled blues, I danced holes in my boots
      D                            G
There weren't another other way to be
    G7                   D          B7
For loveable losers, and no account boozers
    E7         A           D
And honky tonk heroes like me
