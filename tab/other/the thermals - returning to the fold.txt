I regret leaving my soul
   C#m      Abm           F#  E
I forgot I needed it to feel
              B     E     B
maybe when I die
     C#m  Abm                F#         E
I'll just grab it real quick. I'm coming right back

I regret leaving my mind
   C#m      Abm           F#  E
I forgot I needed it to think
              B     E     B
and maybe to keep me alive
     C#m  Abm                F#         E
can't believe I got so far with a head so empty

B                     F#           C#m
but I still have eyes. wait for me. wait for me
B                     F#            C#m
but I still have feet. wait for me. wait for me

I regret leaving at all

and maybe when I die, yeah when I die
     C#m  Abm                F#         E
I will die escaping, I'll die returning to the fold

but I still have feet. wait for me. wait for me

but I still have faith if I ever had faith. wait for me. wait for me
