     G                               D7
I've always been the kind of man who doesn't believe in strings
Em                             B7
Long term obligations are just unnecessary things
    C                  D7                 B7                Em
But girl you've got me thinking while I'm drinking one more beer
       A7           Am                     D7
If I'm headed for a heartache then why the hell am I still here

    G                              D7
I'm testing my resistance and it's wearing mighty thin
Em                                    B7
I've got the feeling I should leave before the roof caves in
   C                D7                B7           Em
My mind tells me to move along but my body begs me stay
          A7               Am                 D7
And now I feel the need to hold you close and love the night away

n/c                        C
While you're turning me... every which way but loose
            G
You turn me every which way but loose
  D7                                G                  G7
Inside the fire is burning me in my mind you just keep turning me
C                          G                 E7
Every which way but loose, baby there's no excuse
           Am          D7      C
To turn me every which way but loose

         G                                      D7
When the sun comes up in the morning, it should find us someplace new
    Em                                 B7
But right this minute all I want is to lay here next to you
      C                   D7              B7              Em
Those memories still keep calling me from somewhere in my past
       A7            Am                   D7
Better hurry if they want me, cause I can feel me fading fast

n/c                        C
While you're turning me... every which way but loose
            G
You turn me every which way but loose
  D7                                G                  G7
Inside the fire is burning me in my mind you just keep turning me
C                          G                 E7
Every which way but loose, baby there's no excuse
           Am          D7      C
To turn me every which way but loose
