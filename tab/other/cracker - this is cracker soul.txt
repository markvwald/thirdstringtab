Hey hey it's okay to make a little mess out of your life
'Cause you don't need a diagram to tell you how to have a good time

I said hey, don't mean to frighten you away
This is Cracker soul, it comes so easy
I said hey, don't get your head a mess
This is just the best, it comes so easy, it comes so easy

Hey hey it's okay to never know the answer but ask why
'Cause you don't need another burden, come and party with your spirit guide

I said hey, don't get your head a mess
This is Cracker Soul, it comes so easy
I said hey, don't get yourself distressed
Love is just the best when comes easy, it comes so easy

I said hey, don't mean to frighten you away
This is Cracker soul, it comes so easy
I said hey, don't get your head a mess
This is just the best, it comes so easy, it comes so easy
