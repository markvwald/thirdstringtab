C                       Am
There is freedom within, there is freedom without
F                                  E7
try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
C                      Am
There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost
F                                                      E7
but you'll never see the end of the road while you're traveling with me

F        G             C          Am    F        G                C           Am
Hey now, hey now don't dream it's over. Hey now, hey now when the world comes in
F          G        C                  Am       F                       G
They come, they come to build a wall between us, we know they won't win

C                     Am
Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
 F                                            E7
my possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
C                  Am
In the paper today, tales of war and of waste
F                                 E7
but you turn right over to the TV page

F        G             C          Am    F        G                C           Am
Hey now, hey now don't dream it's over. Hey now, hey now when the world comes in
F          G        C                  Am       F                       G
They come, they come to build a wall between us, we know they won't win

C  Am  F  E7
F  C  F  C  F  C  Bb

C                    Am
Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
F                                              E7
and I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
C                     Am
Only the shadows ahead barely clearing the roof
F                                     E7
get to know the feeling of liberation and relief

F        G             C          Am    F        G                C           Am
Hey now, hey now don't dream it's over. Hey now, hey now when the world comes in
F          G        C                  Am       F
They come, they come to build a wall between us, we know they won't win

F  G  C  Am
         don't ever let them win
F  G  C  Am
         don't ever let them win
