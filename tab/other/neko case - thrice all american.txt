I want to tell you about my hometown
       G                                  D
It's a dusty old jewel in the South Puget Sound
         G                       C
Well the factories churn and the timbers all cut down
    G                      D G
And life goes by slow in Tacoma

G                           C
People they laugh when they hear you're from my town
     G                               D
They say it's a sour and used up all place
    G                 C
I defended its honor, shrugged off the putdowns
    G                            D  G
You know that you're poor from Tacoma

G                        C
Buildings are empty like ghettos or ghosttowns
   G                                    D
It gives me a chill to think what was inside
  G                        C
I can't seem to fathom the dark of my history
  G                    D  G
I invented my own in Tacoma

          G                    C
There was nothing to put me in love with the good life
       G                                          D
I'm in league with the gangs and the guns and the crime
          G                      C
There was no hollow promise that life would reward you
          G                    D  G
There was nowhere to hide in Tacoma

G                        C
People who built it they loved it like I do
          G                                       D
There was hope in the train yards and something inspired
G                          C
Once was I on it, but it's been painted shut
        G                     D  G
I found passion for life in Tacoma

Well I don't make it home much, I sadly neglect you
    G                                    D
But that's how you like it away from the world
    G                      C
God bless California, make way for the Wal-Mart
  G                          D  G
I hope they don't find you Tacoma
