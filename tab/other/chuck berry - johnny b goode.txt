     A
Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans
way back up in the woods among the evergreens
      D
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
      A
there lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
    E
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
             A
but he could play the guitar just like a ringin' a bell

    A                                         D                    A
Go, go... go Johnny, go, go... go Johnny, go, go... go Johnny, go, go
               E
Go Johnny, go, go... Johnny B. Goode

           A
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
D
old engineers would see him sittin' in the shade
A
strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
     E
when people passed him by they would stop and say
     A
'oh, my but that little country boy could play'

    A                                         D                    A
Go, go... go Johnny, go, go... go Johnny, go, go... go Johnny, go, go
               E
Go Johnny, go, go... Johnny B. Goode

    A
His mother told him, 'someday you will be a man
you will be the leader of a big ol' band
D
Many people comin' from miles around
     A
will hear you play your music when the sun go down
E                                                A
Maybe someday your name'll be in lights, sayin' 'Johnny B. Goode tonight'

    A                                         D                    A
Go, go... go Johnny, go, go... go Johnny, go, go... go Johnny, go, go
               E
Go Johnny, go, go... Johnny B. Goode
