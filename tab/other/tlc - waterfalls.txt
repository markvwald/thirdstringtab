I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms have come and gone leavin' a trace of not good-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray all ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true only my faith can undo, the many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries

My only bleedin' hope is for the folk who can't cope with such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tootin' caine in your own vein what a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane and name this day in time for fallin prey to crime, I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of comin' true, believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you
