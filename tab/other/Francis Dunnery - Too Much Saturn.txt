I always believed that if I ran off to India, wore sandals and shaved my head
     G6
And used Body shop conditioner, and incense like crazy I could call myself a spirit head
     Cadd9
But I only went to India to look on top, I wore sandals cause I'd smoked all my money
     G6
And I shaved off all my hair cause I had the fleas, I'd been sleeping all over
     Cadd9
And the Body shop conditioner was a present from a friend
and the incense used to hide the smell
     G6
Of the drug den that I lay in

And so I ask myself what my motives are for this lying need to look so free
         Dsus2            Am7/G          Em7
And if I tell myself real honestly, what more can I admit to, open up a door
   Am7/G                                         Cmaj7/G           E7
He said I'm gonna find out what I'm here for, he said I'd find out soon

I always believed that if I never missed a Yoga class, read my horoscope in the dailies
     G6
And recycle bottles, and know a Red Indian I could call myself a spirit man
     Cadd9
But I was only doing Yoga cause I fancied the teacher
and stars cause it looked good on paper
     G6
And I only went to church cause my granny gave me money when confession was over
     Cadd9
And I only knew the Indian cause his brother's a dealer
and bottles had a price on their return
     G6
So I could go and play, Oh my my

     Dsus2               Am7/G          Cmaj7/G               G6
And so I ask myself what my motives are for this lying need to look so free
     Dsus2               Am7/G          Em7
And if I tell myself real honestly, what more can I admit to, open up a door
    Am7/G                             Cmaj7/G          E7

So now that you know why I don't love you and now that you see that I'm so scared
     Dsus2               Am7/G
Am I a good man ?     Am I a deep deep man ?

What more can I admit to, open up a door. He said I'm gonna find out what I'm here for
He said I'd find out soon, I got too much Saturn
How can I admit it, open up a door, he said I'm gonna find out what I'm here for
He said I'd find out soon, I got too much Saturn and not enough Moontoo much Saturn
