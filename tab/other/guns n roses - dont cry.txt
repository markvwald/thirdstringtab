Am  Dm  G  C

Am  Dm  G  C
Talk to me softly                       If we could see tomorrow
There is something in your eyes         What of your plans
Don't hang your head in sorrow          No one can live in sorrow
And please don't cry                    Ask all your friends
I know how you feel inside I've         Times that you took in stride
I've been there before                  They're back in demand
Somethin is changin' inside you         I was the one who's washing
And don't you know                      Blood off your hands

F         G     Am
Don't you cry tonight, I still love you baby
F         G     Am
Don't you cry tonight
F         G     C
Don't you cry tonight
          C/B     Am       G
There's a heaven above you baby
F             G     Am
And don't you cry tonight

Am  Dm  G  C
Give me a whisper                      I know the things you wanted
And give me a sign                     They're not what you have
Give me a kiss before you              With all the people talkin'
tell me goodbye                        It's drivin' you mad
Don't you take it so hard now          If I was standin' by you
And please don't take it so bad        How would you feel
I'll still be thinkin' of you          Knowing your love's decided
And the times we had...baby            And all love is real

F         G     Am
Don't you cry tonight
F         G     Am
Don't you cry tonight
F         G     C
Don't you cry tonight
          C/B     Am       G
There's a heaven above you baby
F             G     Am
And don't you cry tonight

Am  Dm  G  C
And please remember                    I thought I could live in your world
that I never lied                      As years all went by
And please remember                    With all the voices I've heard
how I felt inside now honey            Something has died
You gotta make it your own way         And when you're in need of someone
But you'll be alright now sugar        My heart won't deny you
You'll feel better tomorrow            So many seem so lonely
Come the morning light now baby        With no one left to cry to baby

F         G     Am
Don't you cry tonight
F         G     Am
Don't you cry tonight
F         G     C
Don't you cry tonight
          C/B     Am       G
There's a heaven above you baby
F             G
And don't you cry
F              G
Don't you ever cry
F         G     Am
Don't you cry tonight, baby maybe someday
F         G
Don't you cry
F              G
Don't you ever cry
F         G     C
Don't you cry tonight
