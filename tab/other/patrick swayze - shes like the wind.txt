C                              Em    C                           Em
She's like the wind through my tree, she rides the night next to me
    C                                                   Em
She leads me through moonlight only to burn me with the sun
      C                                              Em
She's taken my heart but she doesn't know what she's done

         Am7                     Bm7
Feel her breath on my face,  her body close to me
      Am7                     Bm7       D
Can't look in her eyes, she's out of my league
G       D/F#      Em           D            C
 Just a fool to believe I have anything she needs, she's like the wind

          C                                   Em
Am I just fooling myself that she'll stop the pain
C                            Em
living without her I'll go insane
