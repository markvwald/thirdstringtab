I'm keeping the heat on, I'm doing the best I can
Now I'm looking for something you just wouldn't understand
With a devil in my heart and a shotgun in my hand
A                        E   A                              E
  You're gonna lose this man, I said you're gonna lose this man

I'm living the high life, I got shadows on my tail
Sharper than an old jackknife and poison like a rusty nail
Won't take no for an answer, I'm two steps ahead of the law
  A                                      E
I count my friends on these four fingers, who could ask for more?
A                           E
  I said, who could ask for more?

B                            A             B                            A
Sometimes you gotta let your feelings show, sometimes you gotta let the cold winds blow
B                                 A
Who's gonna pay the piper for the song he sings?
    B                                A      G     E
And who's gonna take some pity on my lonely tired wings?

E

         E
My tired wings, my tired wings, my tired wings, my tired wings
My tired wings, my tired wings, my tired wings, my tired wings
Kick it

Life is such a lonely game if you wanna play
The stakes are high and so am I and sometimes, oh the devil pays
Blood is thicker than water boy and much deeper than your soul
    A                                   E
Gold don't buy too much 'round here, it'll turn your heart to stone
A
  Just turn your heart to stone

B                            A             B                            A
Sometimes you gotta let your feelings show, sometimes you gotta let the cold winds blow
B                                 A
Who's gonna pay the piper for the song he sings?
    B                                A      G     E
And who's gonna take some pity on my lonely tired wings?
