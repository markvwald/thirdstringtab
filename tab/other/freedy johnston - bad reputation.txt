Em                           G
I know I got a bad reputation and it isn't just talk, talk, talk
Am              C                  Em                  D7   C
If I could only give you everything you know I haven't got

Em                              G
I couldn't have one conversation if it wasn't for the lies, lies, lies
Am                   C                  Em                D7
And still I ought to tell you everything 'til I close my eyes

      C      G      C       D                G      C      D
Suddenly I'm on the street, seven years disappear below my feet
              Em                   Am                  D
Been breaking down. Do you want me now? Do you want me now?

             C       G        C
Suddenly I'm down in Harold's Square
D                          G       C    D
Looking in the crowd, your face is everywhere
              Em                    Am                  D
Been turning around. Do you want me now? Do you want me now?

Em Am Em C D

Em                             G
Don't try to be an inspiration, just wasting your time, time, time
Am                 C                 Em              D
You know about the best I'll ever be, see it in your eyes

Em                           G
I know I got a bad reputation and it isn't just talk, talk, talk
Am              C                  Em                  D7
If I could only give you everything you know I haven't got

Suddenly I'm on the street, seven years disappear below my feet
              Em                   Am                  D
Been breaking down. Do you want me now? Do you want me now?

Suddenly I'm in another place, looking in the crowd I think I see your face
              Em                    Am                  D
Been turning around. Do you want me now? Do you want me now?

Do you want me now? Do you want me now?

Don't you think I've heard the talk? Nobody's going to tell me who to love
              Em                   Am                  D
Been breaking down. Do you want me now? Do you want me now?

Just turning around. Do you want me now? Do you want me now?
              Em                   Am                  D
Been breaking down. Do you want me now? Do you want me now?
                  Em          Am         D
I'm just breaking down, down, down, down
              Em          Am         D
Been breaking down, down, down, down
              Em          Am         D
Been breaking down, down, down, down
