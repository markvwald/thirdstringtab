Twenty Five years and my life is still
Bm                                      D               A
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope for a destination

I realized quickly when I knew that I should
         Bm                                    D                     A
That the world was made of this brotherhood of man for whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
        Bm                                     D                        A
Just to get it all out, whats in my head and I, I am feeling a little peculiar
     A
So I wake in the morning and I step outside
      Bm
and I take a deep breath and I get real high and
  D                                          A
I scream at the top of my lungs what's going on?

           A      Bm            D                A
And I said hey... hey... I said hey, whats going on?
           A      Bm            D                A
And I said hey... hey... I said hey, whats going on?

      A                   Bm                 D                 A
And I try, oh my god do I try, I try all the time in this institution
      A                    Bm                        D             A
And I pray, oh my god do I pray, I pray every single day for a revolution

         A
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
        Bm                                     D                        A
