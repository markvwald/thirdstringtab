When you make love, do you look in the mirror? Who do you think of, does he look like me?
            Bm7                       Em7                A7sus                    D
Do you tell lies and say that it's forever? Do you think twice, or just touch and see?
        Bm7   D
Ooh babe   oh yeah

             Bm7              Em7                  A7sus                     D
When you're alone, do you let go? Are you wild and willing or is it just for show?

Ooh come on

 I don't wanna touch you too much baby

When I'm with you are you somewhere else? Am I getting through or do you please yourself?
              Bm7              Em7              A7sus                  D
