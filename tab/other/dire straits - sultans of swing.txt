(intro)
Dm   C   Dm  x2

Dm                                  C             Bb       A
You get a shiver in the dark it's raining in the park but meantime
Dm                       C           Bb         A
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
F                               C
A band is blowing Dixie double four time
Bb                                         Dm   Bb   C
You feel alright when you hear that music ring

Dm                                 C         Bb       A
Well, now you step inside but you don't see too many faces
Dm                C                Bb      A
Coming in out of rain to hear the jazz go down
F                      C
Competition in other places
Bb                                       Dm   Bb   C
Oh, but the horns, they're blowing that sound
                 Bb   C
Way on down south, way on down south London town

Dm   C   Bb   C x2

Dm                     C         Bb            A
You check out Guitar George he knows all the chords
Dm                         C                           Bb    A
Mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
F                         C
Left-handed old guitar is all he can afford
Bb                                             Dm   Bb   C
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

Dm                 C   Bb             A
And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
Dm                  C         Bb      A
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
F                               C
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Bb                       Dm   Bb   C
Saving it up for Friday night
                 Bb   C
With the Sultans, with the Sultans of Swing

Dm   C   Bb   C x2

Dm                                  C         Bb          A
And a crowd of young boys, they're fooling around in the corner
Dm                          C          Bb                         A
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
F                                  C
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
Bb                                Dm   Bb   C
It ain't what they call rock and roll
                Bb   C
And the Sultans, yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole, Creole

Dm   C   Bb   C x2

(solo)
Dm   C   Bb   A x2
F   C

Bb   C
Dm   C   Bb   C x2

Dm                     C         Bb         A
And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone
Dm                C           Bb        A
And says at last just as the time bell rings
F                     C
"Goodnight, now it's time to go home."
Bb                                   Dm   Bb   C
And he makes it fast with one more thing,
                    Bb   C
"We are the Sultans, we are the Sultans of Swing."

Dm   C   Bb   C (repeat to end)
