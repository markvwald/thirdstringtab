They made up their minds and they started packing
     C#7                              F#m
They left before the sun came up that day
   F#7                    Bm
An exit to eternal summer slacking
    F#m                       C#7                  F#m
But where were they going without ever knowing the way?

     F#m                               Bm
They drank up the wine and they got to talking
     C#7                              F#m
They now had more important things to say
         F#7                         Bm
When the car broke down they started walking
F#m                       C#7                  F#m   E
Where were they going without even knowing the way?

                   A                         E
Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved with gold
F#m                         C#7
It's always summer, they'll never get cold
        D                         A                 E
They'll never get hungry, they'll never get old and grey
                  A                 E
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
     F#m                          C#7
They won't make it home, but they really don't care
     D                           A               E     C#7
They wanted the highway, they're happier there today

      F#m                                Bm
Their children woke up and they couldn't find them
     C#7                              F#m
They left before the sun came up that day
     F#7                              Bm
They just drove off and left it all behind them
    F#m                       C#7                  F#m   E
