C                                                                      Am
Driving through the long night, trying to figure who's right and who's wrong
               C
Now the kid is gone
C                                                         Am
I sit belted up tight, she sucks on a match light glowing bronze
         C
steering on
      F                        G
And I might be more a man if I stopped this in it's tracks
              C            Am
and said come on, let's go home
    F                       G                                   Am  F
But she's got the wheel and I've got nothing except what I have on

                             C                                         Am
When you're driving with the brakes on, when you're swimming with your boots on
                     F           G                         Am    F  G
It's hard to say you love someone and it's hard to say you don't

C                                                               Am
Trying to keep the mood right, trying to steer the conversation from
                C
the thing we've done
C                                                             Am
She shuts up the ashtray and I say "It's a long way back now, hon"
             C
and she just yawns
F                                  G
And we might get lost someplace so desolate
                        C               Am
that no one where we're from would ever come
    F                       G                         Am  F
But she's got the wheel and I've got to deal from now on

                             C                                         Am
When you're driving with the brakes on, when you're swimming with your boots on
                     F           G                         Am    F  G
It's hard to say you love someone and it's hard to say you don't

                    C             Am  F
But unless the moon falls tonight
                     Am   F  C
unless continents collide
               Am      F  G
Nothin's gonna make me
               Am   F  G  (hold)
break from her side

                             C                                         Am
When you're driving with the brakes on, when you're swimming with your boots on
                     F           G                         Am
It's hard to say you love someone and it's hard to say you don't
     F                           G                         Am    F  C
It's hard to say you love someone and it's hard to say you don't
