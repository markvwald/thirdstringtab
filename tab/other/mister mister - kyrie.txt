G
The wind blows hard against this mountainside, across the sea into my soul
F                                   G
It reaches into where I cannot hide, setting my feet upon the road

G
My heart is old, it holds my memories, my body burns a gem-like flame
F                                          G
Somewhere between the soul and soft machine is where I find myself again

C        Dm              Em               F      G
  Kyrie Eleison down the road that I must travel
C        Dm                 F               Am    G
  Kyrie Eleison through the darkness of the night
C        Dm               Em             F       G
  Kyrie Eleison where I'm going will you follow?
C        Dm          Em             F      G
  Kyrie Eleison on a highway in the light

G
When I was young I thought of growing old, of what my life would mean to me
F                                        G
Would I have followed down my chosen road or only wished what I could be?

C        Dm              Em               F      G
  Kyrie Eleison down the road that I must travel

  Kyrie Eleison through the darkness of the night
C        Dm               Em             F       G
  Kyrie Eleison where I'm going will you follow?
