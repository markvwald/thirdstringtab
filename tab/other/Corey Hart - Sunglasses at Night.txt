Am                       Am6

Keep track of the visions in my eyes

         F      G
While, she's deceiving me, 
F             G
It cuts my security, has
F            G
She got control of me
   F               G
I turn to her and say

Am                                              F         G

and I wear my sunglasses at night so I can, so I can
F                     G              Am
