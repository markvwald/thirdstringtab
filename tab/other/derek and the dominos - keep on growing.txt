I was laughing, playing in the streets, I was unknowing
  G           D  A
I didn't know my fate
A              D                              A
Playing... the game of love, but never really showing
  G            D          A
I thought that love could wait

E                     D           A
I was a young man and sure to go astray
E                                D
You walked right into my life and told me
                  F#m         E
love would find a way, find a way
              A       D        A       D        A      D
Gotta keep on growing, keep on growing, keep on growing
G     D     A
Yeah, yeah, yeah

      A        D                               A
I was standing, looking in the face of one who loved me
G       D   A
Feeling so ashamed
A           D                                  A
Hoping, and praying, Lord, that she could understand me
      G      D    A
but I didn't know her name

E                            D             A
She took my hand in hers and told me I was wrong
E                                       D
She said, you're gonna be all right boy
           F#m           E
oh just as long, just as long
               A       D        A      D         A      D
As you keep on growing, keep on growing, keep on growing
G     D     A
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Maybe, someday baby, who knows where or when
G        D        A
just you wait and see
         A          D                             A
We'll be walking, together hand in hand, alone forever
G          D       A
woman just you and me

E                                      D            A
'Cause time is gonna change it all, and I know it's true
E                                D
Our love is gonna keep on glowing and
                              F#m              E
growing and it's all we gotta do, all we gotta do

        A       D        A       D        A     D
Keep on growing, keep on growing, keep on growing
