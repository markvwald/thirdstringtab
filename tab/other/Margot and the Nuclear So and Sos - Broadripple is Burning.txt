Capo II

Em C G  2x

          Em             C               G
Children, Broadripple is burning and the girls are gettin' sick
           Em             C                   G
Of huffin' glue up in the bathroom while your boyfriends pick up chicks
                Em                C               G
And darling I'm lost, I heard you whispering that night in fountain square
                 Em              C                    G
The trash filled streets made me wish we were heading home

              Em              C                   G
And there was love inside the basement where that woman used to lie
     Em              C               G
In a sleeping bag we shared upon the floor almost every night
                Em          C                 G
And darling I'm drunk, everything that I have loved is turned to stone
             Em      C         G
So pack your bag and come back home

        Em              C               G       G/F#    Em
And I'm wasted, you can taste it, don't look at me that way
               C              Em           C         G/F#   Em    C G
'cause I'll be hanging from a rope, I will haunt you like a ghost

Em  C G

      Em          C                G
If my woman was a fire, she'd burn out before I wake
         Em                 C            G
And be replaced by pints of whiskey, cigarettes, and outer space
            Em          C                     G
If somebody moves, everything you thought you had will go to shit
            Em         C       G
We've got a lot, don't ever forget that

      Em               C                  G
And I wrote this on an airplane where the people looked like eggs
           Em             C                       G
And when a woman that you loved was gone, she was bombing east Japan
                  Em               C                     G
And don't fucking move 'cause everything you thought you have will go to shit
            Em            C               G
We've got a lot, don't you dare to forget that

        Em              C               G       G/F#    Em
And I'm wasted, you can taste it, don't look at me that way
               C              Em           C         G/F#   Em    C G
'cause I'll be hanging from a rope, I will haunt you like a ghost
