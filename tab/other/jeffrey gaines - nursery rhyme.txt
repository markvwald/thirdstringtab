A                               F#m             G
Where did it start, or should I say when did it end
             D       E                 A
And I wonder how long we were gonna pretend
A                             F#m            G
Now we're apart and we've got wounds we must mend
               D       E               A       E
We both lost a partner, we both lost a friend

       A                    A/G#                    F#m                        E
But to go on and on hand in hand down the path of a future that's paved in the past
          D            D/C#       E
That was another place, place and time
       A                      A/G#                       F#m                        E
And we both realize we're too young for the lies that we told each other year after year
                  D       D/C#     E
Which read like a nursery, nursery rhyme

  A                                F#m           G
I know we'll get by, we'll do what we must to survive
            D               E                          A
I'll find a small town girl, you'll find that artist inside
     A                                   F#m                     G
It's nobody's fault, we just look at the world through different eyes
                  D        E                     A     E
You need your independence, I need someone in my life

       A                    A/G#                    F#m                        E
But to go on and on hand in hand down the path of a future that's paved in the past
          D            D/C#       E
That was another place, place and time
       A                      A/G#                       F#m                        E

  Bm                            E             A              A/G#    F#m
Although I know I'll never stop loving you, I also know it's time to go
    Bm                          E
And there'll be nights when I'm missing you
    A                                    A/G#
And there'll be nights I'll hurt inside, way down deep I'll want to cry
         F#m                    E
But I'll stop myself before I begin
      A                            A/G#
Cause I know now I must be strong, can't get lost in what went wrong
       F#m                   E
Got to turn my collar to the wind
