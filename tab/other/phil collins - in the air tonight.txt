I've seen your face before my friend, but I don't know if you who I am

       Dm                               C
Well I remember, I remember don't worry, how could I ever forget?
         Bb                           F
It's the first time, the last time we ever met
    Dm                                             C
But I know the reason why you keep this silence up, no you don't fool me
        Bb                                                Dm
For the hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows, some stranger to you and me
