My mom gave me this guitar, 19 and 74, it's true

Tried to double park my dreams
                                               D
The dark waltz and a pull over the eyes for routine
                 G
What is a man to do?

C                  D
I used to shy away, sweet darling, calling to explain
       G    Em

Mark's brother Bill played drums
                                     D
Sold weed and he carried a gun, it's true
                               G
A real mean son of a bitch, too

G
So Harry took a grand our way
                                     D
So the band, the band could play for you
                          G
That's all we know how to do

C                  D
I used to shy away, sweet darling, calling to explain

I love you  aww, aww

Your mother aww, aww
