Tarzan wasn't a ladies' man, he'd just come along and scoop 'em up under
    Em       D     Em         D          Am     D
his arm like that, quick as a cat in the jungle

      Em     D      Em         D         Am      D
in no jungle scape, dumb as an ape doing nothing

Hey Bob, Supe had a straight job, even though he could have smashed through any bank
        Em    D       Em         D                Am         D
In the United States, he had the strength, but he would not

Folks said his family were all dead, their planet crumbled but Superman, he forced himself
   Em    D      Em      D             Am     D
To carry on, forget Krypton, and keep going

Em   D       Em          D          C                 G    D
  Tarzan was king of the jungle and lord over all the apes

         Em       D           Em         D            Am    D
till his work was through And nothing to do but go on home

  Superman never made any money for saving the world from Solomon Grundy
G               C             G                C           D
