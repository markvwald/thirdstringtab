I hurt you a lot, you said that you loved me as you packed your bags to go
G                           D                    C                     G   D
  Then you call on the phone to say that you miss me, then why did you go away?

C                                                     D
  Let it go or let it stay I guess I know what you're saying
C                                                               A7
  It gets so cold while you're away that's why I hoped you'd be staying
               D                           G
but now you're leaving on a northern bound train

              C            D              G
I know you're leaving on a northern bound train
            C                D          G
This lonely feeling seems to hit me the same
              C            D              G
since you are leaving on a northern bound train
             C             D        C
I guess I'll dream until I see you again
                      D                          G
Or buy a ticket for myself upon a northern bound train

  The further you run, the less you were leaving, when you come back home to stay
G                   D                  C               G     D
  The deeper in love the harder the crying when she is gone away

C                                                     D
