Em  G  C  Am   2x

Em                                          G
I woke up near Rittenhouse square there was boys in the hall snow flowing the air
            C                                     Am
and I could see just then a flashing spark of the match to my first smoke

Em                                     G
Some houses are built to last it's the people inside that change too fast
      C                                                  Am
I can see their faces looking through the glass, they're not where they belong

E                 A                         F#m                     B
I wanna stay with you babe won't you let me stay you're a beautiful girl
E               A                   F#m                    B
Right where I belong babe here with you you're a beautiful girl

Em  G  C  Am

Em                                                  G
I can see your feet at the edge of the bed while an old love song's creeping into your head
            C                                             Am
and as your eyes just closed I could only guess if you've dreamed of me again
Em                                              G
Stained glass casts a flickering light with the curtains closed I can't tell if it's light
      C                                                 Am
but I know for sure that this sure feels right with you here between my arms

E                 A                         F#m                     B
I wanna stay with you babe won't you let me stay you're a beautiful girl
E               A                   F#m                    B
Right where I belong babe here with you you're a beautiful girl

C                       G         C                         G
And I hope that you can change me when I'm coming out of my head
C                        G                A            D
And I hope that you will keep me, keep me warm in your bed
