If you want I'll be by your side,
A      D           G
If you don't maybe suicide,
G      D            A
It's my love that'd kill me dear,
A            G           D
If you won't hold me and have me near,
G      D            A
Don't you fret and don't be scared,
A      D           G
Cause baby I am a millionaire,
G      D            A
I'll make you a star and I'll make you a queen,
A            G           D
I'll put your face upon a magazine

G      D            A
Okay, so I lied, and none of that's true,
A      D           G
But not having you is making me blue,
G      D            A
And I want you for the rest of my life,
A            G           D
Yes, I want you, to be my wife,
G      D            A
I'll give you a ring and a home sweet home,
A      D           G
And if you want you'll be free to roam,
G      D            A
But not too far I'm begging you please,
A            G           D
Begging you please upon my bended knees

I need you more than a sailor needs a breeze,
A      D           G
I need you more than an Eskimo freeze,
G      D            A
I need your loving more than money or air,
A            G           D
And if you don't love me, baby, that's not fair,
G      D            A

A      D           G
I'll give you loving baby every day,
G      D            A
A loving that's good, a loving that's all right,
A            G           D
A loving like an oven on the coldest night.    Woo!
