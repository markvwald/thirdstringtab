Without the pretty pink ribbon, you'd end up just like me

Without the pretty pink ribbon, you'd float down to the sea
            B                         Abm
Without the pretty pink ribbon, you'd say just what you pleased
            E                            F#
Without the sticky little kitten, you're ticket could never be free

             Eb                       Abm
Without your tight little denim, your virtues would all go unknown
            C#m                         F#
Without the room that you live in, your cancer would eat through the bone

     E                     F#              B                    Abm
Your muscles would bulge underground, Your demons would all be around
            E                 F#  NC
Without the pretty pink ribbon You'd end up just like me
