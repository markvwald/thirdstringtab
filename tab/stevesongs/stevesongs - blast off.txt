we got a countdown coming, and the clock is running

we're gonna count from 10 to 1 then start the fun as we blast off toward the sun

we got a long way to go, a hundred million miles to mars you know

but with this rocket made for flight

we'll be out of sight as we blast off at the speed of light


what a day to fly away over the milky way, over moons, over stars to the planet of mars

we've got all we need for a trip through the galaxy

we're the kid astronauts of planet earth


we got aliens to meet, maybe they've got yellow feet

we're gonna cross the solar system in one day, so many things that we want to say

sharing is the golden rule, so much stuff that we learn from school now

are you ready now 10, 9, 8 oh i can wait 7, 6, 5 for the ride 4, 3, 2, 1

well, we're gonna blast off like an old slingshot

gonna whirl out the back of the parking lot

we'll all blast off ready or not


what a day to fly away over the milky way, over moons, over stars to the planet of mars

we've got all we need for a trip through the galaxy

we're the kid astronauts of planet earth

oh we're the kid astronauts of planet earth, oh we're the kid astronauts of planet earth
