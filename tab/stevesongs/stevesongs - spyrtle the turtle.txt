my friend spyrtle is a loggerhead turtle and she lives on the barrier isles
    G                                D
she likes to eat shellfish but she's not very selfish
       C                          G
so she shares 'em with her fellow reptiles
      G               D                            C                    G
she's 30 years old or so i've been told and she's about to be a mother again
         G                      D
so she's going back to jekyll island all the while
                  C                          G
she's gonna be tryin' to swim as fast as she can

      G                       D                             C              G
she's gonna dig a hole on the beach near the dunes, lay her eggs and swim away
    G                          D
she hopes that that batch will quickly hatch
             C                                G
and that the lids will lay their own eggs someday

C                      D                  Em            A                  C        D
my friend spyrtle is a lovely turtle, she swims and she glides through the sea with me

   Am          C                    G             D
it takes about 2 months for them to rise from the dune
Am        C                     G            D
danger is everywhere, there are crabs and raccoons
     Am               C               G          D           Am  C
they hatch from their eggs, they must follow the moon to the sea

            G                 D                          Am   C
i guess the coral of the story (get it?) is hurry to the sea
                   G                            D                        Am   C
don't stop for a banana sandwich or to pet your llama, just hurry to the sea
                       G                                               D
don't stop to get your car washed (turtle wax), especially if you're a turtle
                           Am                         C
'cause turtles don't drive cars ('cause that would be weird)
                  G
just hurry to the sea
