little baby robin in his little birdie nest

wanted to fly like all the rest of the other birds he saw flying 'round

so he crawled out slowly on a low-hanging twig

felt so small and the world was so big

closed his eyes and tried not to look down

took a leap and flapped his wings but he fell right to the ground


you gotta get up before you do any walking, gotta crawl before you even try

gotta believe in the power to lift you, well it comes from deep inside

there's bound to be trouble that you gotta get over, take it one step at a time

and if you fall, you gotta get back up if you ever want to fly


a bunch of bigger birds who could already fly

they pointed and laughed and said my my my

this little guy looks like he should have stayed in the tree

then his big sister Betsy Bird flew on down, picked little robin up off the ground

and said hey little brother, don't you frown, just listen to me

i used to be a baby bird like you, i know how hard it can be


you gotta get up before you do any walking, gotta crawl before you even try

gotta believe in the power to lift you, well it comes from deep inside

there's bound to be trouble that you gotta get over, take it one step at a time

and if you fall, you gotta get back up if you ever want to fly


well if you wanna fly, just do like i do

spread your wings and bend your knees

shake your tail feathers and check the breeze

take a deep breath and close your eyes, picture yourself flying

flap your wings and if you fall down

don't give up just keep on trying


little baby robin ain't a baby no more

he's big and he's strong and through the sky he soars

faster than any bird that you've ever seen

and when little baby birds having trouble come by

he doesn't point, doesn't laugh, he doesn't make them cry

he just flies over and says listen to me

i used to be a baby bird like you, i know how hard it can be


you gotta get up before you do any walking, gotta crawl before you even try

gotta believe in the power to lift you, well it comes from deep inside

there's bound to be trouble that you gotta get over, take it one step at a time

'cause it's hard to fly, oh yes it is and you have to try like nobody's business

don't you mind what the other birds say, don't fret, don't sweat if it's a rainy day

'cause the sun will shine on you again, so keep your beak up up until the end

and if you fall, you gotta get back up if you ever want to fly

if you fall, you gotta get back up if you ever want to fly

if you fall, you gotta get back up if you ever want to fly
