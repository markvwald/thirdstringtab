walked outside my house one mornin', same old house that i was born in

looked out at the beautiful day and all i saw and all that i could say was

yee haw, what a word, yee haw, quite absurd

now get my hat and get my horse and round up that old herd, yee haw


found myself in amherst city, saw a horse that sure looked pretty

he asked me if i liked to ride, you know what i replied

yee haw, what a word, yee haw, that's quite absurd

now get my hat and get my horse and round up that old herd, yee haw


made it down to tennessee, there was an old man who was looking at me

he offered us a bail of hay and all that we could say was

yee haw, what a word, yee haw, that's quite absurd

now get my hat and get my horse and round up that old herd, yee haw


met a girl in new orleans, the sweetest thing you ever did see

she married me the very next day and all that i could say was

yee haw, what a word, yee haw, that's so absurd

now get my hat and get my horse and round up that old herd, yee haw


well i made it home and i wrote this song, it ain't too short and it ain't too long

i could sing it all day long, now you can sing along

yee haw, what a word, yee haw, that's quite absurd

now get my bat to eat my borsch

i mean get my rat to drive my porsche, wait

get my hat and get my horse and round up that old herd, yee haw
