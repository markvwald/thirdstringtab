on a flying guitar we can go anywhere

both near or far, flying into thin air

we can bring anyone along, sing our song you are there

over land, over trees, over oceans don't you know

that i can't wait 'til the next time that we go


later alligator, do you want a ride?

pick you up, fly around for awhile then drop you on the other side

well that invitation was met with elation, he said

i've been on a train (toot toot) and a plane (doo wee ooh)

a bus with gusts in the middle of the rain

a boat (splash splash) and a car (vroom vroom)

but never before have i been on a flying guitar


on a flying guitar we can go anywhere

both near or far, flying into thin air

we can bring anyone along, sing our song you are there

over land, over trees, over oceans don't you know

that i can't wait 'til the next time that we go


in the middle of the sky Tse Tse the bird flew by

you could tell her surprise by the look in her eyes

she was shocked by the sight of our musical flight, she said up here

i've seen birds (tweet tweet) and clouds (sleet sleet)

a plane flown by Jane down a tangerine street

i've seen a sun (bright light) and stars (night night)

but never before have i seen a flying guitar


on a flying guitar we can go anywhere

both near or far, flying into thin air

we can bring anyone along, sing our song you are there

over land, over trees, over oceans don't you know

that i can't wait 'til the next time that we go


when we sing this song and close our eyes

we all ride along with the rest of the gang into the skies

we can all hop aboard, we'll strum the right chord

upward and outward notes will roar and we'll soar


on a flying guitar we can go anywhere

both near or far, flying into thin air

we can bring anyone along, sing our song you are there, there, there

over land, over trees, over oceans don't you know

that i can't wait 'til the next time, i can't

that i can't wait 'til the next time, i can't

wait 'til the next time that we go
