    Em                   G       C                             D
the building bursts into flames, smoke pours out like from the engine of a train
C                    Em            D
people in the windows call out for help

but here comes captain courageous to the scene

breaks down the doors like a real fire fighting machine

he carries everybody out without a thought for himself


that's what a hero would do, i wanna be a hero too

they are strong, they are sure, look out for others in the face of danger

that's how they save the day the hero way


on monday fireman joe came to our school

he showed us the fire truck and ladder, man that was cool

we even got to spray the hose like a real fire fighter crew

i said i want to be a hero just like fireman joe

said you don't have to fight fires to be a hero

every time you lend a helping hand to someone in need

that makes you a hero too


that's what a hero would do, i wanna be a hero too

they are strong, they are sure, look out for others in the face of danger

that's how they save the day the hero way


i was playing fire fighters at the park with billy, jack and mark

kenny came over, he wanted to play

we only had 4 firefighter hats in all

mark said get outta here Kenny, you're too small

Kenny looked at me sadly with something to say

what would a hero do if he were in my shoes

i said wait, i got an idea

Kenny maybe you could pretend to be an animal stuck up in a tree

and then we could all come and save you

that way could all play, it'll be much better that way

Kenny smiled and everyone agreed, so that's what we did


i think that's what a hero would do, and i was a hero too

i was strong, i was sure, looked out for others in the face of danger

that's how we save the day the hero way

that's how we save the day the hero way
