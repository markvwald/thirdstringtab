issac newton found gravity, apple hit him falling from a tree

he said it seems to me there ought to be a reason for that

maybe it's not falling down as much as earth is pulling it toward the ground

you know you saw my frown when the apply squished my hat


so we're down with gravity baby, down with gravity baby, down with gravity baby

down, down, down, down, down, down, down


so he tested that theory with different planets of the galaxy

he found of course that the pulling force was directly proportional to their mass

larger objects like planets and stars attract smaller ones like people and cars

they pull us in, we could have been floating into space like a gas


but instead we're down with gravity baby, down with gravity baby, down with gravity baby

down, down, down, down, down, down, down

down with gravity baby, down with gravity baby, down with gravity baby

down, down, down, down, down, down, down


don't you hate it when you fall down and scrape your knee?

or when you're making an ice cream cone and the top scoop plops off onto the sidewalk?

or when you're walking down the street and you fall into a bottomless pit

never to be seen again?

no of course you don't, nobody has, forget that question

what about if you knock open a pi√±ata and all the prizes come pouring out?

candy is falling from the sky

all this talk about things coming down reminds me of a story

about two kids who have a run in with a little something called gravity

how about our friends jack and jill, they made their way up that hill

a well of water to seek

jack fell and crumbled his crown, jill laughed so hard she fell down

all thanks to that gravity

and they were down with gravity baby, down with gravity baby, down with gravity baby

down, down, down, down, down, down, down

with gravity baby, down with gravity baby, down with gravity baby

down, down, down, down, down, down, down

with gravity baby, down with gravity baby, down with gravity baby

down, down, down, down, down, down, down

with gravity baby, down with gravity baby, down with gravity baby

down, down, down, down, down, down, down

with gravity baby, down with gravity baby, down with gravity baby

down, down, down, down, down, down

down, down, down, down, down, down

down, down, down, down, down, down, down
