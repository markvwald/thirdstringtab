thanks a pack of pickles, it really tickles me to know you care

thanks a bunch of bananas, i'm a big fan of your big red hair

thanks a ton of tuna, it won't be soon enough 'til we're back here again

thanks a mashed potatoes, it's really great-o we're such good friends


'cause you're the bee's knees, you're the hosting hostess with the mostess

cat's pajamas, you're the cow that jumps over the moon

you're supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

what would i do without friends like you?  i couldn't do without friends like you


oh thanks a line of lizards, it don't take wizards to know we're friends

always in the middle, in the beginning and at the end

we've got stacks of stories of all the glorious times we've seen

thanks a dozen donuts, i really go nuts when you're with me


'cause you're the bee's knees, you're the hosting hostess with the mostess

cat's pajamas, you're the cow that jumps over the moon

you're supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

what would i do without friends like you?  i couldn't do without friends like you


the best part of my day oh looking at it right now, what can i say?

just a smile or a joke will do, to sing these songs and share this time with you

it's my favorite thing to do do do do, do do do do do


'cause you're the bee's knees, you're the hosting hostess with the mostess

cat's pajamas, you're the cow that jumps over the moon

you're supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

what would i do without friends like you?  i couldn't do without friends like you

no no, i couldn't do without friends like you
