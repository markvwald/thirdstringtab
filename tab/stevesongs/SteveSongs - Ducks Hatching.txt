Ducks hatching from our classroom incubator, that's what we've been waiting for

We got 12 eggs from a special farm in Idaho

they're different than the ones at the store
Am                          D
We're all excited for those ducklings to come out and play
G                       C
just like we saw in the color brochure

The incubator's set at 99.5 degrees to keep those eggs warm all day
   G                            C                        Am                      D
We have to turn them over about once every two hours and my turn to turn 'em's today
          C                           G
These are usually the things that the mother duck does
    D
but she's not around so it's up to us

Those ducks hatching in our classroom incubator anytime now hopefully

Mrs. Grimsley says that they have beaks and legs and hair now
                         C
but they still look like eggs to me
Am                     D
We made a sign saying "Welcome Our New Feathered Friends"
G                              C
If they'd just come out they'd see

We turned off all the lights this morning, and lit a candle to see through the shells
          F                        G                      Am                   D
You could almost make out a little shadow of a body and a foot, it was hard to tell
        C                                G
But the next thing that happened was the biggest surprise
           D
We heard a crack and looked over.  We couldn't believe our eyes
         C                      G
We saw a little duck beak and a little duck eye
       D                          G
then a whole duck and head poking out from inside
            C                         G
And then he poked all the way out and let out a quack
       D
and it didn't take long before we heard another crack
             C                              G
And then the third then the fourth then the fifth and then soon we had a
D
whole duck and farm in our old classroom

      Am                      D                   G                        C
Those ducks hatching from our classroom incubator, coolest thing I've ever seen
Am                      D                                 G                  C
Mrs. Grimsley says that we can take them home for the weekend if we keep 'em clean
Am                   D                      G               C
They're gonna have a chance at a great life if we work as a team
