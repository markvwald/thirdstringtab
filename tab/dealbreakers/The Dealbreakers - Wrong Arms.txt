Capo I

[Intro] C G D (2x)

G                              Bm     D
Well the snow don't fall in the day no more, it falls at night
G                         Bm     D     C G D
Ten minutes in bed and I fall asleep with the lights on
G                              Bm          D
You spend a lot of time with different guys, say you're just talking
G                         Bm     D     C G D
And as I leave with a different girl I see you walking away
          C G D
Yeah walking away
                    C
But do you have something to say to me?

     G     Em     D          C          G     Em
Or can I fall............ fall into the wrong arms again tonight?
D          C     G     Em
Fall into the wrong arms again tonight
D          C     G     D
Fall into the wrong arms again, yeah

C G D

G                              Bm     D
You like to talk more about leaving town but you don't go there
G                         Bm     D     C G D
Everyone you could need is here but you don't know who they are
G                              Bm          D
At the show last night I tried to sing about just what we are
G                         Bm     D     C G D
But I couldn't hear a thing because the alcohol and those guitars
          C G D
Were screamin' in my head
               C
What were you saying to me?

     G     Em     D          C          G     Em
Or can I fall............ fall into the wrong arms again tonight?
D          C     G     Em
Fall into the wrong arms again tonight
D          C     G     D
Fall into the wrong arms again, yeah

C                    D               G     F#/D  Em
Sometimes I'm falling and I wonder if your arms could even catch me
C          D
So tell me babe, do you have something to say to me?

'fore I fall into the wrong arms tonight?
Fall into the wrong arms again tonight
Fall into the wrong arms again tonight

C     G     D (4x)
