Capo IV

[Intro] C F Am G (2x)

C                         F
We couldn't say girl, We couldn't be for real
Am               G          C F
So write down every single thing you feel
C                         F
We shouldn't stay girl, It's biting on our heels
Am               G          C  F
So right now I can't see through your appeal

F               G
Say that this ain't easy, See my point of view
F                         G
I swear this is the best that I can do

C          F     Am               G
How can I never be right? How can you never be sane?
C          F                         G
How can we be something but the sound just isn't the same?
C               F     Am               G
How can this always be rough? And how come I am always in love
C               F               G
Until same good questions tell me that it's fading away?

[2 measures of C]

C                         F
Sometimes its so easy girl, But I just disappear
Am               G          C F
And I can be so cold but I'm sincere

C                         F
Some things are cloudy girl, Some things are crystal clear
Am               G          C F
So I'll be so far gone when you get here

F               G
Say that this ain't easy, See my point of view
F                         G
I swear this is the best that I can do

(soft)
C          F     Am               G
How can I never be right? How can you never be sane?
C          F                         G
How can we be something but the sound just isn't the same?
C                    F     Am               G
(loud) How can this always be rough? And how come I am always in love
C               F               G
Until same good questions tell me that it's fading away?
