G  D  C x6

G                 D                 C
Walking through a crowd the village is aglow
G               D         C
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
G         D           C
Everybody here wanted something more
G               D               C
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before

            G              D    C
And it said Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
G              D             C
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
G              D    C

  It's a new soundtrack, I can dance to this beat, beat
       Em                      D                            C
Forevermore, the lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me

     G                    D        C
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
G               D                C
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
G         D                C
Everybody here was someone else before
            G
And you can want who you want
D                 C
boys and boys and girls and girls

G              D    C

Em       D          C
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Em       D         C
Like any real love, it's ever changing
Em       D         C
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
