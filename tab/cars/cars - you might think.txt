You might think I'm crazy to hang around with you
D                   G        A                 D
Maybe you think I'm lucky to have something to do
      Bm    A           G       Bm      A       G
But I think that you're wild, inside me is some child

D                   G           A           Bm
You might think I'm foolish, oh baby it's untrue
D                   G      A             D
You might think I'm crazy, all I want is you

You might think it's hysterical, but I know when you're weak
    D                   G          A               D
You think you're in the movies and everything's so deep
      Bm    A           G             Bm         A       G
But I think that you're wild when you flash that fragile smile

D                   G       A                Bm
You might think I'm foolish, what you put me through
D                      G      A             D
You might think you're crazy, all I want is you

And it was hard, so hard to take
G       A    Bm   G    A     Bm
There's no escape, without a scrape
G  A  G  (no chord)                                 A
       But you kept it going 'til the sun fell down, you kept it going

     D                     G            A             D
Well you might think I'm delirious, the way I run you down
    D                   G                    A                     D
But somewhere, sometimes, when you're curious, I'll be back around
      Bm    A           G         Bm  A       G
And I think that you're wild, and so uniquely styled

D                    G             A            Bm
You might think it's foolish, this chancy rendezvous
D                   G      A             D
You might think I'm crazy, all I want is you
G     A       Bm         G    A  D
All I want is you, all I want is you
