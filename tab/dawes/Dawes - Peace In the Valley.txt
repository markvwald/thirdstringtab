intro
Cmaj	Dadd11/G	D	Dadd11/G

Cmaj				   Dadd11/G	D
I think these walls have a message or have changed
			Dadd11/G	Cmaj
Which it is I can't decide
			Dadd11/G	D
So I leave with the writer that remains
				Dadd11/G	Cmaj
And let him tell me what his better days were like

And I sit with the memory of kings
With only words to criticize
As if I finally found the antidote for pain
Without knowing what that's really like

	Cmaj		D
And our actor ends his love song
		G		Cmaj
And all these lovers sit and stare
				G
If I don't find peace in the valley
				D
It's cause there wasn't any there

Am	Cmaj

I will move somewhere the ocean's never seen
Somewhere weeds just make their place
Where my best friend's exist only on screen
Where my love all fits and frays

But I want fire tumbling out into the night
I want you to know why you hold me close
Pull the quarter from my ear, or say you tried
I need magic or the holy ghost

And as I drive on through these canyons
I'm still feeling like a crook
If I don't find peace in the valley
I've got no place else to look
