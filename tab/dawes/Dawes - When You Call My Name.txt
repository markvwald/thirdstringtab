intro
A	Bm	F#m	E 	x2

verse
A		F#m		E
If all my lovers sing the big words
A		F#m		E
And all my brothers keep them small
Bm			E						A
Then I get lost in the difference, between their whisper and the echo of their call

A		F#m		E
So I am headed for the ocean,
A		F#m		E
to let the sea-smoke guide me in
Bm			E						F#m
I'll give up my belongings and questions, they only ever taught me to begin

chorus
A
So I will not turn around, as I step up to the train,
Bm			F#m		E
But I'll hear it when you call my name
A
And I will not be the sound, of your roof under the rain,
Bm			F#m		E
But I'll hear it when you call my name

verse
So I am taking off my wrist watch,
to let the time move how I please
To let my day be guided by the sunlight, through mornings knell and twilights soft release

So if you want to get to know me,
follow my smile into it's curves
All these lines are born in sorrows and in pleasures
and every man ends up with the face that he deserves

chorus
So I will not give you bread, as you reach out from your cage,
But I'll hear it when you call my name
And I will not give applause, as you step off of the stage,
But I'll hear it when you call my name

verse
There's a river running through the city
Gently reminding me what's what
Of course, you are invited to come with me, but I don't think that's really what you want

I think you want a world that will hold you,
Through security, and gravity, and love
And I can't think of anyone who'd blame you, and I can't think of how that'd be enough

chorus
So I won't come back around, when you've cursed the ground you've tamed,
But I'll hear it when you call my name
And when you realize once I'm gone, that I never really came,
Oh, I'll hear it when you call my name

chorus
And when the burden of the sun, reveals to you it's pain,
Oh, I'll hear it when you call my name
And when you realize that you're wrong, but you still give me all the blame,
I'll hear it when you call my name.
