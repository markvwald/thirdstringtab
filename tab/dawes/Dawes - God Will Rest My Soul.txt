intro
G

G	C	G
Take a last look around
G	C	D7
Take the fall that is due
D#dim	Em
And take your time,
		G
and I'll take mine
	C		G	C	G
It's the last thing that's left for us to do

You have tried to define romance,
And all the things that it is not
Your time became some old man's cane
While he dances to a song that he forgot

Em				C		G
Oh, you can't throw something out there without watching it fall
		Em		C		G
Only thing that's scarier than dying is not dying at all
		D	G/B	C
So when I have lost all my control
	D		G
God will rest my soul

I guess your mind can leave your heart
I guess that's what you're doing now
But it doesn't make us friends
Or better men
It is not something that love would allow

Oh you can't throw something out there without watching it fall,
Only thing that's scarier than dying is not dying at all
So when I have lost all my control
God will rest my soul

Dm			Dm6/C			C	G
And just like how I'll drink myself through my seventh relapse,
Dm			Dm6/C		C		G
Like a captain of his sinking ship clutches to his maps
	Dm		C			Bb	F
What the figure on the cross thinks with his one final gasp-
C		G
This too shall pass

Oh you can't throw something out there without watching it fall,
Only thing that's scarier than dying is not dying at all
So when I have lost all my control
God will rest my soul
