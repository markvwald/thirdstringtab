intro
Bb	Eb	Dm	F(I)
Eb	Bb	Gm	F(II)	Eb

Bb		Eb
Some time as a much older man
	Dm			F(I)
I will sit down and put on this song
Eb			Bb
It just might make me cry,
	Gm	F(II)		Eb
Or at the very least a tear in my eye

I can't take all these years of my life
To be whittled down into a thought
That only appears to the year
I made memories perfectly clear

Mama, mama, Mama, mama

I just want to be making my mind,
Keep from changing my mind not to change
Cause I'm greedy as the sea,
And that's how it always will be
I'll be somebody now, and I'll be somebody then,
And I'll be all of you all in between
And then I'll be ready to leave
When the whole world is taken with me

Mama, mama, Mama, mama
Mama, mama, Mama, mama

	Cm			F
Cause there're so many days in a year
	Cm			F
And there's so many years in my head
	Eb			Bb
So I think about when I'll be dead,
	Eb			Bb
And how those very last moments get spent
	Eb						F(I)
And if I think about you is that something you think you'd accept?

Some time as a much older man
I will sit down and put on this song
It just might make me cry,
Or at the very least a tear in my eye.
