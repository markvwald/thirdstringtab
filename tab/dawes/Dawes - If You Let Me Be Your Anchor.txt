I want love to stretch it's fingers wide
Dsus2                Dadd9       A
And touch on all our wandering parts
                           Gmaj7  F#m
Come sit by my Californian side
Dsus2     Dadd9    A
With your Carolina heart

A             Gmaj7   F#m
If you let me be your anchor
Dsus2  E        A
I will hold you down
A             Gmaj7   F#m
If you let me be your anchor
Dsus2  E        A
I will hold you down

If I see the thin trace of his hands
Let the winter pay all my dues
Let me forgive every single man
That before me came to you

If you let me be your anchor
I will hold you down
If you let me be your anchor
I will hold you down

So find me when you welcome back your roots
And I will be where all of your ends meet
I want the feeling waking next to you
I want to find my children at your feet

If you let me be your anchor
I will hold you down
If you let me be your anchor
I will hold you down

oooohhhhhh
oooh oh oh oh oh oh
oooohhhhhh
