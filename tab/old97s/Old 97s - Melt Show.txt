In the front row at the Melt show. I fell in love with you and that was three weeks ago
           A     D                       E
We fooled around, you let me have it for free
A                                                     D
Yeah it worked out real nice. I showed you how to and you showed me paradise
                   A    D                 E
Now you're killing time, and it's killing me

And this thing we have, will it mean anything when October rolls around?

Will you sober up and let me down?     Will you sober up and let me?

There's a schoolyard out the back door
                      D
I used to love it but I don't believe in school no more

You don't learn anything, you're just waitin' around
A
With your big brains and your know-how
                                 D
if there was a reason you'd have figured it out by now.
                        A    D                      E
A little gettin' some's good, while you're waitin' around.

Now my bad dream is my best friend. You were here last night but now you're gone again
