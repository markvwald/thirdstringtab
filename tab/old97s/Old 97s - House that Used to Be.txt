Do you wanna wind up in a graveyard like a number on a scorecard?

They're gonna wrap you up in corn silk. They're gonna cry like you were spilled milk

You'd better take another Quaalude and get yourself corkscrewed

I understand that you got cold feet, but why'd you have to take 'em down a side street?

I must be dumber than a spit curl 'cause I got hung up on a showgirl

Now I look like I'm a scarecrow. I might as well go on a talk show

And this ain't home anymore. It's just four walls and a floor

You're gonna wind up in a graveyard, just another girl who co-starred
                             D                                           A

And in the far off wail of freight trains and in the lonely howl of Great Danes

I hear the girl I lost forever, I hear the girl I lost forever
