When I first met Doreen she was barely seventeen
        D                             Am
She was drinking whiskey sours in the bar
    Em                                 G
The way she tossed 'em back I would've had a heart attack
    D                           Am
But as it is I let her drive my car
   Em                                   G
We galloped through the boroughs like a pair of horny thoroughbreds
  D            Am
Until I said, "Stop the car, Doreen."
             Em                           G
Well you can roll your eyes and nod but I swear that I saw God,
       D                                 Am
In the moonlight on a side street in the wreckage we call Queens

  G       D    Am                         C
Doreen, Doreen, last night I had an awful dream
         G                       D
You were laying in the arms of a man I'd never seen
     Em      G          Em      G
Come clean Doreen. Come clean Doreen

Well I'm pulling into Cleveland in a seven-seater tour van
        D                                   Am
There's eight of us, so I'm sleeping on the floor
    Em                                G
The guy that plays the banjo keeps on handing me the Old Crow
      D                             Am
Which multiplies my sorrow, I can't take it anymore

  G       D    Am                         C
Doreen, Doreen, last night I had an awful dream
         G                       D
You were laying in the arms of a man I'd never seen
     Em      G          Em      G
Come clean Doreen. Come clean Doreen

Now I'm begging and I'm pleading, "Well pull over guys, I'm bleeding
          D                           Am
There's a Fina off the highway with a phone."
    Em                         G
I'm calling you Doreen, but it rings and rings and rings
      D                                 Am
Where is it that you are, if you aren't in our bed at home

  G       D    Am                         C
Doreen, Doreen, last night I had an awful dream
         G                       D

     Em      G          Em      G
Come clean Doreen. Come clean Doreen
