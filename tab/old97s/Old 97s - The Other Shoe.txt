Tune down one full step

              D                  G
One old brown shoe falls in slow motion
    Bm               G                A
and bedsprings hover right above your head
              D              G
As bedsprings do when your beneath them
Bm                G                 A
Someone else just climbed into your bed

       G                                      D       D7
By the time she thought you'd probably got to Phoenix
G                                   A     A7
she'd arranged for your shoes to be filled
Bm              F#m          Em           G
You've got your pride, and a blue steel .45
         Em              G             D     D7
and your waiting for the other shoe to fall
          Em              G             D
Yeah your waiting for the other shoe to fall

                 D                G
You dig a double grave out in the meadow
        Bm                  G                 A
and you curse the rain that turns the dirt to mud
          D                 G
You take 35 south towards Laredo
        Bm            G
and you try to find a doctor
        Bm            G             Bm              G
That'll prescribe an elixir that'll make everything better
            Bm                G
except your late wife and her lover

       G                                      D       D7
By the time she thought you'd probably got to Phoenix
      G                                  A     A7
she'd sealed her fate and gotten herself killed
Bm              F#m          Em           G
You've got your pride, and a blue steel .45
         Em              G             D    D7
and your waiting for the other shoe to fall
          Em              G             D
Yeah your waiting for the other shoe to fall
          Em              G             D
Yeah your waiting for the other shoe to fall
          Em              G             D
Yeah your waiting for the other shoe to fall
