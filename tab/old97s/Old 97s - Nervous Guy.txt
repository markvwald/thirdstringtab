       Dm                     Bb
In the court of our friends' opinion
       Dm                        Bb
In the right cut eyes of all our friends
       F                  Eb           Dm               Bb
in the way the phone goes dead, in the way you use your head
      Dm           Bb             Dm
i can see how this thing is gonna end

       Dm                    Bb
in the darkest hours of my depression
       Dm                         Bb
in the tumbling rocks it takes to mend
       F                 Eb           Dm                Bb
in the way you cross you legs, in the way my right hand shakes
      Dm           Bb             Dm
i can see how this thing is gonna end

       F       Eb       Dm Bb   Dm
Goodbye, goodbye from a nervous guy
       F       Eb       Dm Bb   Dm
Goodbye, goodbye from a nervous guy

         Dm                   Bb
When the smoke pours into the bedroom
         Dm                                  Bb
When the man comes 'round collecting all our friends
         F                 Eb              Dm             Bb
When the loved one finally learns that the fire no longer burns
      Dm      Bb                  Dm
I can see how this thing is gonna end

       F       Eb       Dm Bb   Dm
Goodbye, goodbye from a nervous guy
       F       Eb       Dm Bb   Dm
Goodbye, goodbye from a nervous guy
       Dm Bb   Dm
From a nervous guy
