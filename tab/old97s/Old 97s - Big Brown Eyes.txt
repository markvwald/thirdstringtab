tune down one full step

Am

          G
Big brown eyes, and a gust of wind
        D
and the cherry burns the corner of the page that says "The end
          G
Is coming soon".  But not soon enough
D
Restring all your guitars. Pack up all your stuff
          C        Am/B   Am
'Cause if Robert's dad is right,
             C       Am/B        Am
We might not make it through the night,
        C       Am/B  Am
And I'd hate to go alone
                   D
Please pick up the phone

           G
Well a box of red, and a pill or three
        D
and I'm calling time and temperature just for some company
                G
I wish you were here. I wish I was too
     D
I'll drink myself to sleeplessness, I always do
          C       Am/B  Am
You don't want me anymore
      C                Am/B           Am
Since fame and fortune broke down our door
          C       Am/B  Am
You don't give me no respect
             D
What did I expect?

    G                   Am            C     D
And if that phone don't ring one more time
    G                 Am         C     D
I'm gonna lose what's left of my mind
    G            Am             C            D
You made a big impression for a girl of your size
G               Am         C            D         G
Now I can't get by without you and your big brown eyes
Am  C            D         G

Am  C       D         G
       Your big brown eyes
G  Am  C  D

Am

G
Her hands are cold, her breath is warm
        D
She's a port in a storm
G
I'm worried now, but it won't be long
   D
It takes a worried man, you know, to sing a worried song
         C      Am/B      Am
I've got issues      yeah
       C        Am/B      Am
Like I miss you      yeah
      C      Am/B       Am
And I wish I weren't so thick
                  D
I'm making myself sick

    G                   Am            C     D
And if that phone don't ring one more time
    G                 Am         C     D
I'm gonna lose what's left of my mind
    G            Am             C            D
