Do you wanna mess around? Do you wanna spend the night?
                         A                         E
I've known both kinds of love but I want to get it right this time

                     E                             F#m
I don't wanna settle down, I don't want to make no plans
                          A                      E
Except for what I'm gonna do with a pair of idle hands

                    F#m                E
They're tearing the Buick City Complex down
                  Bm                  A
I think we're the only people left in town
                    F#m                       A
Where are you gonna move, where are you gonna move?
                   E
Do you wanna mess around?

Do you wanna be my girl, Do you wanna be my friend
                      A                           E
Do you wanna start it off just to see how it will end

                   E                               F#m
Do you wanna mess around? I mean deep down in your bones
                    A                    E
In a hotel swimming pool or a public telephone
