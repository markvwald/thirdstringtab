Tune down one full step

A  C

G                     Em
There was a fine rain, there was a red wine
Am                       D
There was a long whistle, it was a good sign

G                       Em
There was a band playin' somewhere off-screen
Am                     D
There was a girl sayin' "Come clean"

C   D          G
In a dream on a bus
     A           C
On a busted afternoon
     D         G
In a haze on a bus
     A           C
On a busted afternoon
     D            G           A    C
In a bad way on a busted afternoon

G                     Em
There was a sad truth, there was a punchline
Am                       D
There was a long whistle, it was a good sign

G                              Em
There was a long, (there was a long) goodbye
Am                             D
There was a long, (there was a long) goodbye

C   D          G
In a dream on a bus
     A           C
On a busted afternoon
     D         G
In a haze on a bus
     A           C
On a busted afternoon
     D            G           A    C
In a bad way on a busted afternoon

G  Em  Am  D 2x

C   D          G
In a dream on a bus
     A           C
On a busted afternoon
     D         G
In a haze on a bus
     A           C
On a busted afternoon
     D            G           A    C
In a bad way on a busted afternoon
