Left you last night on the left coast. I'm writin' you a letter right now
    D                  G             A                           D
The things that you do renderin' you something' I can't live without

D                                                     A
Maybe maybe I've got a pulse now. Maybe my heart's on fire

But a bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage is worth a bird on a telephone wire

D                                                                  A
Left you last night on the left half of the land of the free to be burned
         D                     G                          A                      D
Well the heat of your touch is makin' it such and I've forgotten everything I've learned

D                                                  A
Maybe maybe I've got a problem. Maybe my heart's a liar
      D                           G                         A                        D

Left you last night on the left half of the bed, the half that used to be mine
         D                         G            A                        D
Well the way that you sleep is the image I keep always on the edge of my mind

D                                                        A
Maybe maybe I got a reason for livin' even though I'm so tired
      D                           G                         A                       D

Maybe maybe you are the only one my heart's desired
