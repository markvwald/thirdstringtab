Tune down one full step

          D               F#
I've been down, I've been down too far to care
       G                             Bb
I keep getting in my car but I'm not going anywhere
              D            F#
And I've been had, well at least that's how it looks
             G                             Bb
And it's not funny like on TV and it's not smart like it is in books
      D                            F#
And I wonder yeah I wonder how the world keeps spinnin' 'round
G                                Bb
Where's a boy with bad intentions gonna settle down?

            D   Bb                D    Bb
And I don't know what you've been told
    E                    G                                     D
The streets of where I'm from are paved with hearts instead of gold
         E                    G                                     D

I recall when I was 23
G                          Bb
Wondering how anyone could fall in love with me
            D           F#
But now I'm old and I'm well past 25
    G                               Bb
And I can't seem to fall in love no matter how I try
      D                                F#
And I wonder where I'll wind up but I'm headed west I know
G                               Bb
Wind my way through Texas and into New Mexico
