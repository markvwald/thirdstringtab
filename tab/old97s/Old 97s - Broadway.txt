Tune down one full step

Dm         Bb                  Dm                 F
In a hotel room just off Times Square it's like a closet
Dm              Bb               F      C
I can watch the dancing class go round
Dm         Bb                 Dm          F
In a hotel room that costs as much as my apartment
Dm              Bb               F     C
I can watch the working class go down

A                                 Bb
And it's enough to make a crooked man go straight

Dm         Bb                  Dm                 F
In a hotel room just off Times Square they made a monster
Dm        Bb                F    C
He was unaware of what went down
Dm            Bb             Dm            F
Fattening him up just like a calf before a slaughter
Dm           Bb             F     C
He'd had his fill of hollow town

A                                Bb
And it's enough to make a stupid man think straight
     F  C  Dm  Bb       F  C  Dm  Bb
