Tune down one full step

Em                        Am      C        B7           Em
I watch as it stops for a girl. A moment, elaborate and weak
Em               Am          C              B7                 Em
I am easy in her midst. Why elaborate, when there's no need to?

      Dm     Am     C                  B7            Em
But I do all night. My words ring like money off the bar
          Dm     Am         C            B7          Em
But she's here, asleep now. One can only go alone so far
C            B7          Em
One can only go alone so far

  Em                   Am    C            B7             Em
I dream of a deep dark grave seven feet below Saint Augustine
Em                       Am             C                  B7                 Em
And she's so easy in her breathing. Why fall in love, when there's no need to?

       Dm     Am     C                      B7             Em
But we do all night. Sleep like spoons, and forget whom we are
          Dm              Am              C            B7          Em
But she's here, and she's wound down now. One can only go alone so far
C            B7          Em
One can only go alone so far

Em  Am  C  B7  Em
Em  Am  C  B7  Em

Dm     Am     C                      B7             Em
But we do all night. Sleep like spoons, forget whom we are
Dm              Am              C            B7          Em
But she's here, and she's wound down now. One can only go alone so far
C            B7          Em
One can only go alone so far
C            B7          Em
One can only go alone so far

C  B7  Em
