I remember the Alamo, I don't recall who won
         C                               F
They had swords, they had horses, I hear we had mighty guns
         C                                F
Like the ones from Navarone last night on Channel 21
           G                F
And it's a long way back to El Paso

       C                           F
It was early Monday morning in the Central Standard Zone
         C                      F
You were quiet like the TV, not like the telephone
         C                               F
You were sleeping next to me, I might as well have been alone
           G                   F
And it's a long way back to El Paso

C                     G                   Dm                      Am
And if my heart was a car, you would have stripped it a long time ago
C                     G                   Dm                      Am
And if my heart was a car, you would have stripped it a long time ago
C                     G                  Dm                   Am
And if my heart was a car you would have stripped it down and sold it off
       Dm                Am
to the greasy man in the salvage lot
Dm            Am            G                F
As it is it's just a heart. No, no, it ain't worth nothin'

        C                          F
I ain't talkin' bout tomorrow, I'm talkin' 'bout tonight
    C                               F
You told me you were drunk already, that don't make it right
    C                                        F
You want at me, well, have at it, 'cause I'm in the mood to fight
           G                   F
and it's a long way back to El Paso

C                     G                   Dm                      Am
And if my heart was a car, you would have stripped it a long time ago

And if my heart was a car, you would have stripped it a long time ago

And if my heart was a, and if my heart was a, and if my heart was a car
C                     G                     Dm                     Am
And if my heart was a, and if my heart was a, and if my heart was a car

C                     G                  Dm                   Am
And if my heart was a car you would have stripped it down and sold it off
