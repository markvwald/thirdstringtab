I've got eyes for you and I keep them in a jar up in my room
     A                G          C                 D        A
When you walk in they open wide. Lids have got, no place to hide
         E        A             E        A
I've got eyes for you. I've got eyes for you

A                                                          E
I've got lips for you. Some of what they say just might be true
            A               G                       C                   D         A
Well it's a scary thought I must confess, you're an ice cream cone in a mini-dress
         E        A             E        A
I've got lips for you. I've got lips for you

Oh well I think I'm going crazy, I'm feeling pretty good. This isn't love
            D
It's just I think my body likes you more than any body should
E
Your body likes me too
                D        C   B
That's why I've only got eyes for you

I've got a nose for you, and the way you smell I wish that I had two
            A              G                          C               D         A
Ah well you always smell a bit like gin. You're gonna make me take to drinkin' again
