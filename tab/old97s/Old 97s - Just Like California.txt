Am        Am/B  Am             Am/B  E7
Just like Cali..fornia was not even  there
Am         Am/B     C      D              Am     E7    Am
Since it's gone I'm so withdrawn, I ain't got no one nowhere
Am      Am/B     Am               Am/B  E7
Right beside the ocean my darlin' Clementine
         Am        Am/B         C         D       Am        E7    Am
Well the water got high and she never got dry and she was a water sign

Dm  Am        E7     Am
Time... is on my bad side
Am      Am/B       C           D           Am            E7    Am
Halfway there just wouldn't be fair so I'm goin' all the way tonight
Am      Am/B       C           D           Am            E7    Am

Just like Cali..fornia to make a fool of me
Am        Am/B      C        D      Am      E7     Am
Steal the sideshow, burn the disco, slide into the sea
Am    Am/B     Am                  Am/B      E7
I'm a thinking person, and I think that it's wrong
   Am      Am/B   C           D            Am        E7      Am
to keep on saying true love's waiting when true love is long gone

Dm  Am        E7     Am
Time... is on my bad side
