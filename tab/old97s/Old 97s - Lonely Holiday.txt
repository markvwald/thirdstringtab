It was a lonely holiday. I was alone, you were away

In Fayetteville or in another state. There's so many towns I hate

When you leave me, it breaks me like a bone, but it's never as bad as when you come home
                              E              B               A
I've thought so much about suicide. Parts of me have already died

E                    B                       A
Lonely, baby I'm not lonely. Baby I'm not -- I've got my imaginary friends
E                  B                     A
Happy, baby I'm so happy. Baby I'm so -- I've got my imaginary friends
                 F#m                          A
And if you don't love me, would you please pretend?

It was a lonely holiday. I was alone, I was afraid
                               E              B             E
The bedroom walls were closing in. It must be closing time again
                                         B                                    A
When you leave me, it breaks me like the note that you said got stuck in your throat
