Tune down one full step

Last night I dreamt of you, Abbie Hoffman peddling your books
                              D               C              G
I gave five bucks to you, the other kids just gave you dirty looks
                     C                                 G
I said "I'm sorry it didn't work out quite the way you planned."
                            D        C            Am
You said, "That's silly boy, the revolution is at hand."
                                  D             C
And if you got a ten spot brother, I got a dime
N/C                 D          G      C  G  C
These are desperate, desperate times

Last night I dream to you, Pepe Lopez strung out on a stage,
                            D             C                G
It don't even look like you, smiling like sawed-off twenty gauge
                     C
I still remember the Telecaster down around your knees
G                        D               C            Am
It's late November and I think I smell tequila on the breeze

                                D              C
And if you got the Cuervo honey, I got the lime
N/C                 D          G      C  G  C
These are desperate, desperate times
Am                               D               C
And if you got the shotgun honey, I got the crime
N/C                 D          G      C  G  C
These are desperate, desperate times
