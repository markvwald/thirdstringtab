Tune down one full step

            G                          D
I've got my wife, the other women, and whiskey killing me
    C
The first two make it so that I see red
    D                          D7
The third one makes it so that I can't see
   G                             D
If I had half a brain left after my debauchery
         C            D             Em C   G  D
I'd give up the other women, and the W-I-F-E

C                               G
Wedding vows weren't made to be broken
C                                       G
These here lips weren't made to tell no lies
C                                  Em        D    C
Somewhere along the way, I guess I must have gone astray
           C                  D              G
'Cause I'm drinking here, and wishing for to die

            G                          D
I've got my wife, the other women, and whiskey killing me
    C
The first two make it so that I see red
    D                          D7
The third one makes it so that I can't see
   G                             D
If I had half a brain left after my debauchery
         C            D             Em C   G  D
I'd give up the other women, and the W-I-F-E

C                                G
It's just like my dear old momma told me
C                             G
In the end, you reap what you sow
C                               Em    D     C
I've been sowing seeds from Mexico to Tennessee
        C              D            G
And I'm reaping now an awful lot of woe

            G                          D
I've got my wife, the other women, and whiskey killing me
    C
The first two make it so that I see red
    D                          D7
The third one makes it so that I can't see
   G                             D
If I had half a brain left after my debauchery
         C            D             Em C   G  D
I'd give up the other women, and the W-I-F-E
         C            D             Em C   G  D
I'd give up the other women, and the W-I-F-E.
