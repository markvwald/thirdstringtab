Tune down one full step

C          Am           F            C
Heartbreak, old friend, goodbye it's me again
C       Am        F               C
Of late, I've had some thought of movin' in
C                      F                 G
Of all the many ways a man will lose his home
            C          Am              F                 C
Well, there ain't none better than the girl who's movin' on

C         Am     F                C
True love, I knew thought some of leavin' you
C           Am     F          C
Bad thoughts I had, when valentines were due
C                      F                  G
Of all the many ways a man will break his heart
           C          Am             F              C
Well there ain't none meaner than he pulls his own apart

     G                         C
Valentine, the destroyer, valentine, you belong
       F                C           G
in the stars, where you are, always rollin' on
Am          Em           F              G
Cried, I've cried till I couldn't carry on
       C              Am                F             C
It's a lonely, lonely feelin' when your valentine was wrong
       C              Am                F             C
It's a lonely, lonely feelin' when your valentine was wrong
