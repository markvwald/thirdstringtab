Tune down one full step

G                                   C
When you were just a little girl in Pine Bluff
     D                           G
your daddy disappeared without a trace
G                                   C
Now there's no more little girls in Pine Bluff
D                                   G
they all ran like tears out of this place

G             C
Am I too late, am I too late
D                                            G
Tell you that I love you now they carry you away
G             C
Am I too late, am I too late
D                                            G
Tell you that I love you now they carry you away

G                                    C
I never thought that you would see a sickbed
  D                                    G
I never thought that you'd stop bein' 'round
G                              C
Maybe you are lost and gone forever
      D                                G
just like all the other girls in town

G             C
Am I too late, am I too late
D                                            G
Tell you that I love you now they carry you away
G             C
Am I too late, am I too late
D                                            G
Tell you that I love you now they carry you away

G                                C
Now I hear that you have gone to Heaven
D                                             G
and if there's one, I'm sure that's where you are
G                                C
Maybe you're the new star in the night sky
D                                G
right outside the moonroof on my car

G             C
Am I too late, am I too late
D                                            G
Tell you that I love you now they carry you away
G             C
Am I too late, am I too late
D                                            G
Tell you that I love you now they carry you away
