Tune down one full step

D

D
The empty bottle was half empty, tide was low and I was thirsty
G
Saw her sitting at the bar, you know how some girls are
D                           A             G
Always making eyes, but she wasn't making eyes

     D
So I sidled up beside her, settled down and shouted hi there
         G
My names Stuart Ransom Miller, I'm a serial lady killer
         D                             A               G
She said I'm already dead, and that's exactly what she said

D
So we tripped, the light's fantastic, we was both made of elastic
G
Midnight came and midnight went, I thought I was the president
         D                        A            G
She said do you have a car, I said do I have a car?

          A                       D               A          D
What's so great about the barrier reef? What's so fine about art?
          G                       D
What's so good about a good times van?
          A                                         G                   D
When your workin' on a broken, workin' on a broken, workin' on a broken man
          A                                         G                   D
When your workin' on a broken, workin' on a broken, workin' on a broken man

D
My heart wasn't in it, not for one single minute
G
I went through the motions with her, her on top and me on liquor
D                        A               G
Didn't do no good, but I didn't think it would

          A                       D               A          D
What's so great about the barrier reef? What's so fine about art?
          G                       D
What's so good about a good times van?
          A                                         G                   D
When your workin' on a broken, workin' on a broken, workin' on a broken man
          A                                         G                   D
When your workin' on a broken, workin' on a broken, workin' on a broken man
