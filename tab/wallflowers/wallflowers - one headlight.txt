G                           D     F#m                              Bm
So long ago, I don't remember when, that's when they say I lost my only friend
G                                     D
Well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
F#m                                  Bm
As I listened through the cemetery trees

G  D  F#m  Bm

G                                    D               F#m                     Bm
I seen the sun comin' up at the funeral at dawn, the long broken arm of human law
G                               D
Now it always seemed such a waste, she always had a pretty face
       F#m                              Bm
I wondered how she hung around this place

G  G  F#m

F#m  G                     D
Hey, come on try a little, nothing is forever
Em                  A
got to be something better than in the middle
G               D                   Em
me & Cinderella, put it all together
                    A             G
We can drive it home with one headlight

G                    D
She said it's cold, tt feels like Independence Day
      F#m                          Bm
And I can't break away from this parade
 G                               D
But there's got to be an opening somewhere here in front of me
   F#m                              Bm
Through this maze of ugliness and greed
G                                D
And I seen the sun up ahead at the county line bridge
   F#m                                    Bm
Sayin' all there's good and nothingness is dead
G
We'll run until she's out of breath
    D
She ran until there's nothin' left
 F#m                                Bm
She hit the end-it's just her window ledge

G  G  F#m

F#m  G                     D
Hey, come on try a little, nothing is forever
Em                  A
got to be something better than in the middle
G               D                   Em
me & Cinderella, put it all together
                    A             G
We can drive it home with one headlight

  G                           D
Well this place is old, it feels just like a beat up truck
         F#m                              Bm
I turn the engine, but the engine doesn't turn
 G
Well it smells of cheap wine & cigarettes
     D
This place is always such a mess
    F#m                                 Bm
Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn
  G                                 D
I'm so alone, and I feel just like somebody else
       F#m                                  Bm
Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same
     G                                          D
But somewhere here in between the city walls of dyin' dreams
  F#m                               Bm
I think her death it must be killin' me

G  G  F#m

F#m  G                     D
Hey, come on try a little, nothing is forever
Em                  A
