            D                       G                               A                   D
Walkin down Main Street, gettin' to know the concrete. Lookin for a purpose from a neon sign
        D                         G                               A                     D
I would meet you anywhere western sun meets the air. I'll hit the road, never lookin' behind
          D                   Em               G                     D
Can you deny, there's nothin' greater, nothin' more than travelin' hands of time
        D                       Em                      A                          D
St. Genevieve can hold back the water, but saints don't bother with a tear stained eye

       D             G                                     A                          D
Seein' traces of the scars that came before written in the pavement, still askin' for more
         D                                G
When the hours don't move along, worn-out wood and familiar songs
             A                                   D
To hear your voice is not enough, is more than a shame

          D                   Em               G                            D
Can you deny, there's nothin' greater, nothin' more than travelin' hands of time
        D                       Em                      A                          D

Like a man said, rode hard and put away wet. Throw away the bad news and put it to rest
              D              G
If learnin is livin' and the truth is a state of mind
                 A                        D
you'll find it's better at the end of the line

          D                   Em               G                            D
Can you deny, there's nothin' greater, nothin' more than travelin' hands of time
