G  C  2x

        G                          D
Now and then, it keeps you runnin', never seems to die
Bm                             C
Trail spent with fear and not enough livin' on the outside
G                            D
Never seem to get far enough, stayin' in between the lines,
     Bm                         C       G               C
Hold on to what you can, waitin for the end, not knowin when

        G                                     D
May the wind take your troubles away, may the wind take your troubles away
     C                      G                           D                        G
Both feet on the floor, two hands on the wheel, may the wind take your troubles away

G  D  C  G  D  G

D                          C                 G
Try and make it far enough, to the next time zone
        D
Few and far between past the midnight hour,
C               G                        Em
you never feel alone, you're really not alone

G  C  2x

G                 D
Switch it over AM, searchin' for a truer sound
        Bm                              C
can't recall the call letters, steel guitar and settle down
G                             D
catchin' an all night station, somewhere in Louisiana
Bm               C           G            C
Sounds like 1963 but for now, sounds like heaven

        G                                     D
May the wind take your troubles away, may the wind take your troubles away
     C                      G                           D                        G
Both feet on the floor, two hands on the wheel, may the wind take your troubles away

May the wind take your troubles away, may the wind take your troubles away
