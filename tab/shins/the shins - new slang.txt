 Am   Am/E        C              F
Gold teeth and a curse for this town
 C              G
Were all in my mouth
     C             F           Am    G
Only I don't know how they got out, dear
 Am   Am/E   C         F
Turn me back into the pet
   C           G
I was when we met
       C        F           Am   G
I was happier then with no mind set

                        C
And if you'd a took to me like
   F    C            G
A gull takes to the wind
                         C
Well, I'd a jumped from my tree
    F      C               F          C
And I'd a danced like the king of the eyesores
         F           C             G
And the rest of our lives would'a fared well

 Am   Am/E          C            F
New slang when you notice the stripes
     C             G
The dirt in your fries
           C              F
Hope it's right when you die
         Am  G
Old and booony
 Am    Am/E         C                F
Dawn breaks like a bull through the hall
   C            G
Never should'a called
        C            F            Am  G
But my heads to the wall and I'm lonely

                        C
And if you'd a took to me like
  F     C            G
A gull takes to the wind
                         C
Well, I'd a jumped from my tree
    F      C               F          C
And I'd a danced like the king of the eyesores

God speed all the baker's at dawn
         C               G
May they all cut their thumbs
          C           F               Am    G
And bleed into their buns â€˜till they melt away

                       C
I'm looking in on the good life
            F      C        G
I might be doomed never to find
                       C
Without a trust or flaming fields
    F     C         G
Am I too dumb to refine?
                        C
And if you'd a took to me like
     F      C               F           C
Well I'd a danced like the queen of the eyesores
         F           C             G
And the rest of our lives would'a fared well
