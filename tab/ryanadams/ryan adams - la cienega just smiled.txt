Oh the night, here it comes again, it's on with the jeans, the jacket and the shirt
F           G             C                     Am
How'd I end up feeling so bad for such a little girl

And I hold you close in the back of my mind, feels so good but damn it makes me hurt
    F                 G             Am    G        F
And I'm too scared to know to how I feel about you now
     F                 G             C
La Cienega just smiles, and "see ya around"

And I hold you close in the back of my mind and raise my glass 'cause either way I'm dead
F                     G          Am    G  F
Neither of you really help me to sleep anymore
Am            G            F
One breaks my body and the other breaks my soul

La Cienega just smiles as it waves goodbye
