Who can guess the secret of the sea, who can guess the secret of the sea
   D                              Cmaj7
If you can guess the secret of my love for you
       Am                  C      D      G
And we both could know the secret of the sea

Tell me could you ever tell the secret of the sea
         C            Cmaj9            D
Of these high rolling waves along the shore
    G                 Bm          C            G
The footprints of the lovers that come here to love
       Am                   C    D
By the tides washed away forever more

G                 Em     D      G    Em      G         Em            G

You claim to know the secret of a kiss and a hug
        C             Cmaj9            D
And the secret of the grass and of the trees
   G                Bm          C           G
If you can tell the secret of a warm friends hand
        Am                 C      D      G
then we all would feel the secret of the sea
