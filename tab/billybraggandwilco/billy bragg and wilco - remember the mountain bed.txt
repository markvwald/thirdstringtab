D                        A               G
Do you still sing of the mountain bed we made of limbs and leaves?
                                               D           A
Do you still sigh there near the sky where the holly berry bleeds?
    Bm           A           G                 Em                     G
You laughed as I covered you over with leaves, face, breast, hips and thighs
    D                      C           Em       G    D
You smiled when I said the leaves were just the color of your eyes

D                A                      G
Rosin smells and turpentine smells from eucalyptus and pine
                                       D                 A
Bitter tastes of twigs we chewed where tangled woodbines twine
Bm            A     G                 Em                 G
Trees held us in on all four sides so thick we could not see
D                   C        Em       G      D
I could not see any wrong in you, and you saw none in me

D                   A                       G
Your arm was brown against the ground, your cheeks part of the sky
                                         D              A
Your fingers played with grassy moss, as limber you did lie
     Bm      A       G                         Em                G
Your stomach moved beneath your shirt and your knees were in the air
     D                      C        Em       G               D
Your feet played games with mountain roots as you lay thinking there

D                       A                      G
Below us the trees grew clumps of trees raised families of trees, and they
                                                  D                 A
As proud as we tossed their heads in the wind and flung good seeds away
    Bm      A           G               Em                   G
The sun was hot and the sun was bright, down in the valley below
      D                  C          Em      G    D
Where people starved and hungry for life so empty come and go

D                      A                   G
There in the shade and hid from the sun we free'd our minds and learned
                                        D                A
Our greatest reason for being here, our bodies moved and burned
Bm           A        G                 Em                    G
There on our mountain bed of leaves, we learned life's reason why
D                C        Em          G             D
People laugh and love and dream, they fight and they hate to die

    D                    A                       G
The smell of your hair I know is still there, if most of our leaves are blown
                                                      D                 A
Our words still ring in the brush and the trees where singing seeds are sown
     Bm        A       G               Em                    G
Your shape and form is dim, but plain, there on our mountain bed
  D               C         Em        G          D
I see my life was brightest where you laughed and laid your head

  D                      A                 G
I learned the reason why man must work and how to dream big dreams
                                        D              A
To conquer time and space and fight the rivers and the seas
  Bm         A              G                 Em               G
I stand here filled with my emptiness now and look at city and land
  D                  C          Em       G       D
I know why farms and cities are built by hot warm nervous hands

     D                           A                  G
I've crossed many states just to stand here now, my face all hot with tears
                                                   D             A
I've crossed city and valley, desert and stream to bring my body here
   Bm          A            G                Em             G
My history and future blaze bright in me and all my joy and pain
D                         C        Em          G         D
Go through my head on our mountain bed where I smell your hair again

D                   A               G
All this day long I linger here and on in through the night
                                           D                A
My greeds, my joys, my cravings, hopes, my dreams inside me fight
   Bm         A          G                   Em             G
My loneliness healed, my emptiness filled, I walk above all pain
D                        C         Em       G      D
Back to the breast of my woman and child to scatter my seeds again

D  C  Em  G  D
