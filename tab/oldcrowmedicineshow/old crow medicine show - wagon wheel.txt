G                        D                         Em                   C
Headed down south to the land of the pines and I'm thumbin' my way into North Caroline
G                       D                 C
Starin' up the road and pray to God I see headlights

  G                         D                Em                      C
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours, pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
          G                         D             C
And I'm a hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

   G                   D            Em              C
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel, rock me mama anyway you feel
G  D     C
Hey mama rock me
G                     D                  Em                  C
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain, rock me mama like a south-bound train
G  D     C
Hey mama rock me

G                     D
Runnin' from the cold up in New England
      Em                         C
I was born to be a fiddler in an old-time string band
   G                     D               C
My baby plays the guitar, I pick a banjo now

        G                            D
Oh, the North country winters keep a gettin' me now
        Em                       C
Lost my money playin' poker so I had to up and leave
      G                       D                    C
But I ain't a turnin' back to livin' that old life no more

   G                   D            Em              C
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel, rock me mama anyway you feel
G  D     C
Hey mama rock me
G                     D                  Em                  C
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain, rock me mama like a south-bound train
G  D     C
Hey mama rock me

G                    D
Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
           Em                           C
I caught a trucker out of Philly, had a nice long toke
    G                           D                 C
But he's a headed west from the Cumberland Gap to Johnson City, Tennessee

      G                   D
And I gotta get a move on fit for the sun
          Em                         C
I hear my baby callin' my name and I know that she's the only one
    G                      D                C
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

   G                   D            Em              C
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel, rock me mama anyway you feel
G  D     C
Hey mama rock me
G                     D                  Em                  C
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain, rock me mama like a south-bound train
G  D     C
Hey mama rock me
