As soon as I get my head 'round you, I come around catching sparks of you
I get a little electric charge from you. A second hand living it just won't do

        F            G              C                  F
And the way I feel tonight, I could die and I wouldn't mind
            F                    G
and there's something going on inside

C                                          F                  G
Makes you wanna feel, makes you wanna try. Makes you blow the stars from the sky
      C                                   F                 G       C      F G
And I can't stand up I can't cool down, I can't get my head off the ground

As soon as I get my head 'round you, I come around catching sparks of you
and all I ever got from you is all I ever took from you

        F                  G        C                  F
And the world could die in pain and I wouldn't feel no shame
            F                     G
and there's nothing holding me to blame

C                                          F                  G
Makes you wanna feel, makes you wanna try. Makes you blow the stars from the sky

And I'm taking myself to the dirty part of town where
F               G      C            F                       G
all my troubles can be found. I say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
