  Dear mother, can you hear me whining?
E                 D                      G           A    B 
  It's been three whole weeks since that I have left your home
E             D                E 
  This sudden fear has left me trembling
E              D               G        A     B 
  Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own
        G          A  B 
And I'm feeling so alone

E             G                      A              C 
Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
E              G                   B 
  Some call it slums, some call it nice
  E                G                     A               C     E  B 
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home      
           E        D  A   E  D  A 
Welcome To paradise

E           D                E 
  A gunshot rings out at the station
E         D                G            A   B 
  Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
E             D              E  
  It makes me wonder why I'm still here
E                  D               G            A  B 
  For some strange reason it's now feeling like my home
        G        A  B 
And I'm never gonna go

E             G                      A              C 
Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
E              G                   B 
  Some call it slums, some call it nice
  E                G                     A               C     E  B 
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home

  Dear mother, can you hear me laughing?
E               D                       G           A    B 
  It's been six whole months since that I have left your home
E             D              E 
  It makes me wonder why I'm still here
