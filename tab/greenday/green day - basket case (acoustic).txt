Do you have the time to listen to me whine
 Ano5             E                 B
About nothing and everything all at once

  Sometimes I give myself the creeps, sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
   A5               B5    E5        D5       C#m

Am I just paranoid? I'm just stoned

I went to a shrink to analyze my dreams
    Ano5              E                      B
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down

I went to a whore, he said my life's a bore
   Ano5            E                       B
