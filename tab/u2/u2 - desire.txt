  Yeah

main riff
lover I'm off the streets
Gonna go where the bright lights and the big city meet
              D      A
With a red guitar on fire

main riff
Desire

She's the candle burning in my room
I'm like the needle, needle and spoon
Over the counter with a shotgun
Pretty soon, everybody got one
        D                A
And the fever when I'm beside her

main riff
Desire, desire

D  A     D  E
Burning, burning

main riff
She's the dollars, she's my protection
She's the promise in the year of election
Sister, I can't let you go
I'm like a preacher stealing hearts at a traveling show
For the love or money, money, money, money...
        D                A
And the fever when I'm beside her

Desire, desire, desire, desire

E
