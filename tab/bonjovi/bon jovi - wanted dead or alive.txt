It's all the same, only the names will change
    C         G               G   F    D
And every day, it seems we're wasting away
 D                      C         G
Another place where the faces are so cold
    C         G             G   F    D
I'd drive all night just to get back home

      C      G     F           D
I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride
    C      G  G    F   D         C      G  G    F   D
I'm wanted... dead or alive, I'm wanted... dead or alive

Sometimes I sleep, sometimes is not for days
    C             G       G        F        D
the people I meet, always go their separate ways
    D                             C           G
Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink
    C                  G         G       F     D
And times when you're alone, and all you do is think

      C      G     F           D
I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride
    C       G       G    F   D     C       G       G    F   D
I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive, wanted (wanted) dead or alive

Ooooh and I'm a cowboy, on a street horse I ride

I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive

         D                            C             G
And I'll walk these streets, a loaded six string on my back
  C              G         G         F       D
I play for keeps, 'cause I might not make it back
       D                     C        G
I been everywhere, still I'm standing tall
     C              G               G      F    D
I've seen a million faces, and I've rocked them all

Dead or alive, dead or alive, dead or alive, dead or alive
