C               G             Am
I can't spare a moment on the dog-faced boy
F              G                 C
I won't lend another hand to the worm girl of Hanoi
E7                              F
Don't deplete my oxygen for the guy who's turning blue
    C                   G            C
But ask me, and I'll do anything for you

           C                                   G  G7
Whenever I think of you, it only makes me feel sad
           G7                                   C
Whenever I think of you, the best friend I ever had
         Bb             C
Before I gave it up for nothing

        C                                      G  G7
Well, I lied and I cheated and it made me feel bad
   G7
It made me feel guilty for not bein' true

For the months I spent searchin' for a way to explain
                                              C
In the end all I could do was turn my head in shame

           C        C7      F                         D
Whenever I think of you, oh darlin', it makes me feel sad
       G7
'Cause you deserve better, and once I was it
                                           C
Somehow my good intentions just got up and git

   F               G             C
So I can't spare a moment on the dog-faced boy
F             G                  C
I won't lend another hand to the worm-girl of Hanoi
E7                              F
Don't deplete my oxygen for the guy who's turning blue
    C                   G            C
But ask me, and I'll do anything for you
