A
Down with disease, three weeks in my bed
Trying to stop these demons that keep dancing in my head

D7#9  F  G  2x

A
Down with disease, up before the dawn
A thousand barefoot children outside dancing on my lawn

D7      C#7   C7
Dancing on my lawn

A                         G             D
Waiting for the time when I can finally say
     G                 D             G             D
That this has all been wonderful but now I'm on my way
A                             G              D
But when I think it's time to leave it all behind
G               D               G             D
I try to find a way but there's nothing I can say to make it stop

Down with disease and the jungles in my mind
They're climbing up my waterfalls and swingin' on my vines

So I try to hear the music but I'm always losing time
'Cause they're stepping on my rhythm and they're stealin' all my lines

D7#9  F  G  2x

D7      C#7   C7
Stealin' all my lines

A                         G             D
Waiting for the time when I can finally say

That this has all been wonderful but now I'm on my way
