A                C           G             D
It's hidden far away, though someday I may tell
A                  E             Em              D
The tale of mental tangle when into your world I fell
A           C                    G           D
Without you now I wander soaking, secretly afraid
A                     E                       Em                 D
But in your grasp the fears don't last, though some of them have stayed

A          D              E       D                 A
I wheeled around because I didn't hear what you had said
            D             E     D              A
And saw you dancing with Elihu, up on Leemor's bed
          D             E           D               A
And I was foggy, rather groggy, you helped me to my car
    D              E             D
The binding belt enclosing me, a sample in a jar

           A               C                    G                 D
And on the market stands unfolding with all the willies and their wares
A             E                        Em                    D
I shuffle by alert but numb to all the glances and the glares
A                C               G                 D
I think of you unheeding all the times I raised my cup
A                    E                 Em              D
It's now I know that you knew that I'd soon end up end up

    C                   D          A             G
You tricked me like the others and now I don't belong
    C                 D                   E
The simple smiles and good times seem all wrong
