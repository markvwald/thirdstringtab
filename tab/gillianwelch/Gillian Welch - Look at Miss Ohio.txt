Oh me oh my oh, look at Miss Ohio
        F                       C       G
She's a-running around with her rag-top down
           F                  C          G
She says I wanna do right but not right now

Gonna drive to Atlanta and live out this fantasy
F                       C       G
Running around with the rag-top down
       F                  C         G
Yeah I wanna do right but not right now
