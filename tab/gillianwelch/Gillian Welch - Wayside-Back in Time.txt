G                                         C
Standing on the corner with a nickel or a dime
                  G                    G/F#     Em
There use to be a rail car to take you down the line
G                                      C
Too much beer and whiskey to ever be employed
                  G                          G/F#      Em
and when I got to Nashville, it was too much soldiers joy
G                                    C
Wasted on the wayside, wasted on the way
                G                    G/F#   Em
If I don't go tomorrow, you know I'm gone today

G                  C                G                  Em
Back baby, back in time. I wanna go back when you were mine
G                  C                Em  D              G
Back baby, back in time. I wanna go back when you were mine

Bm                      C
Black highway all night ride
             Em   D                 C
Watching the times fall away to the side
Bm                     C
Clear channel way down low
             Em  D                C
Is comin' in loud and my mind let go

G                                        C
Peaches in the summertime, apples in the fall
                    G                          G/F#    Em
If I can't have you all the time, I won't have none at all
G                                                 C
Oh, I wish I was in Frisco in a brand new pair of shoes
                    G                       G/F#      Em
I'm sittin' here in Nashville with Norman's Nashville blues
G                                                  C
So come all you good time rounders listenin' to my sound
                     G                     G/F#    Em
And drink a round to Nashville before they tear it down

G                  C                G                  Em
Back baby, back in time. I wanna go back when you were mine
G                  C                Em  D              G
Back baby, back in time. I wanna go back when you were mine

Bm                    C
Hard weather, drivin' slow
                Em  D                    C
Buggies and the hats are in town for the show
Bm                        C
Oh darlin, the songs they played
          Em  D         C
All I got left of lovin' me

G                  C                G                  Em
Back baby, back in time. I wanna go back when you were mine

Back baby, back in time. I wanna go back when you were mine
