C                         F         C
Look out boys, 'cause I'm a rollin' stone
G                        F          C
That's what I was when I first left home
F                            C
I took every secret that I'd ever known
    Am     G       F    Am     G        C
And headed for the wall like a wrecking ball

C                   F       C
Started down on the road to sin
G            F             C
Playing bass under a pseudonym
F                            C
The days were rough and it's all quite dim
       Am   G               F  Am      G        C
But my mind cuts through it all like a wrecking ball

F  C  Am                      F      C        F       C
Oh... just a little deadhead. Who is watching, who is watching?
F  C     Am
I... was just a little deadhead

F       C           F      C
I won a dollar on a scholarship
G                     F              C
Well, I got tired and let my average slip
F                        C
Then I's a farmer in the Pogonip
          Am        G   F   Am          G        C
Where the weed that I recall was like a wrecking ball

C                                F      C
I met a lovesick daughter of the San Joaquin
G                        F     C
She showed me colors I'd never seen
F                       C
Drank the bottom out of my canteen
     Am      G      F   Am      G        C
then left me in the fall like a wrecking ball

C               F              C
Standin' there, in the morning mist
G                      F         C
A Jack and Coke at the end of my wrist
F                    C
Yes, I remember when first we kissed
       Am     G          F  Am      G        C
Though it was nothing at all like a wrecking ball

F   C     Am                  F     C         F     C
Hey boys, a little deadhead.  Who's watching, who's watching?
F C      Am
I... was just a little deadhead

F             C      F          C
With too much trouble for me to shake
G                       F        C
Oh, the weather and the blindin' ache
F                         C
Was ridin' high until the '89 quake
        Am    G          F    Am      G        C
Hit the Santa Cruz garden mall like a wrecking ball
