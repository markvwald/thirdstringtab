If only there were time and tenderness, oh for young hearts of wilderness
   Am                 Dmadd9             Cadd9                      Dmadd9
We run to the city we build our nest, we work we get drunk, we make love

    Cadd9                            Dmadd9
But your love won't take me from the grave to the heavens
Cadd9                            Dmadd9
Your love won't take me from the grave to the heavens

Before I'm gone your arms will be holding some other man
  Cadd9                           Dmadd9
Before I'm gone your arms will be holding some other man

Am      C                   G        Am
In this heart of wilderness, in this heart of wilderness
F         G      F       G           F       G
Come with me and take my hand, we'll run and dream in this heart

Am                Dmadd9              Cadd9               Dmadd9
Make believe everything's alright and kiss my lover a cold good night

My heart's still filled with fright, I'm still the same broken piece of clay

In this heart of wilderness, in this heart of wilderness

I've been dreaming of something underneath the hill
Cadd9                    Dmadd9
Just around the bend and underneath the hill
Am                    Dmadd9            Cadd9               Dmadd9
A fortune in wood and steel, restaurants and people without names

Cadd9           Dmadd9            Cadd9           Dmadd9
Oh sweet Jesus, I'm a broken man, oh sweet Jesus, I'm a broken man
Am            Dmadd9               Cadd9                    Dmadd9
All I did was follow the plan, but what I wouldn't do to be loved

Am      C                   G        Am
In this heart of wilderness, in this heart of wilderness
F         G      F       G           F       G
Come with me and take my hand, we'll run and dream in this heart
