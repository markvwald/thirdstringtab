In the town where I was born lived a man who sailed to sea
C      D       C      G    Em     Am      C     D
And he told us of his life in the land of submarines
C     D        C      G    Em     Am        C      D
So we sailed unto the sun 'til we found the sea of green
C      D       C         G     Em     Am     C    D
And we lived beneath the waves in our yellow submarine

G                D
We all live in a yellow submarine
                  G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
G                D
We all live in a yellow submarine
                  G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

C       D           C    G      Em   Am           C         D
And our friends are all aboard. Many more of them live next door
C       D      C       G    G   D
And the band begins to play

G                D
We all live in a yellow submarine
                  G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
G                D
We all live in a yellow submarine
                  G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

As we live a life of ease, everyone of us has all we need
C      D        C      G     Em     Am     C    D
Sky of blue and sea of green in our yellow submarine
