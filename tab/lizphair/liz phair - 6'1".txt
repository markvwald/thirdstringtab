I bet...      you fall in bed too easily
         Ab        Eb        Bb        Ab
with the beautiful girls who are shyly brave
        Eb       Bb      Ab       Eb
and you sell yourself as a man to save

    F#      C#    F#     C#       B    Eb   Bb  Ab
But all the money in the world is not enough

Eb  Bb  Ab  Eb        Bb         Ab
I bet...       you've long since passed
Eb   Bb       Ab      Eb         Bb    Ab
understanding what it takes to be satisfied
       Eb     Bb        Ab             Eb
You're like a vine that keeps climbing higher

It's cold...      And rough
    F  C      Bb                F  C-D#  Bb
And I... kept standing six-feet-one
                     F  C-D#  Bb
instead of five-feet-two
               F  C-D#  Bb
and I loved my life
