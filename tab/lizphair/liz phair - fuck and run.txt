D          A       F#m                   G
I woke up alarmed, I didn't know where I was at first
          D2                A2       Bm                 G2
just that I woke up in your arms and almost immediately I felt sorry
       D                         A             F#m                    G
'Cause I didn't think this would happen again, no matter what I could do or say
          D2                        A2           Bm                 G2
just that I didn't think this would happen again with or without my best intentions
    D                      A              F#m                      G
And whatever happened to a boyfriend, the kind of guy who tries to win you over?
    D2                     A2             Bm                    G2
And whatever happened to a boyfriend, the kind of guy who makes love 'cause he's in it?

And I want a boyfriend, I want a boyfriend, I want all that stupid old shit
     G           D2     G           D2
Like letters and sodas, letters and sodas

D                 A    F#m                G
You got up out of bed, you said you had a lot of work to do
    D2                       A2       Bm                 G2
But I heard the rest in your head and almost immediately I felt sorry
       D                         A             F#m                    G

And I want a boyfriend, I want a boyfriend, I want all that stupid old shit
     G           D2     G           D2
Like letters and sodas, letters and sodas

E             A            E                       Dadd4
I can feel it in my bones, I'm gonna spend another year alone
              D             A    F#m             G
It's fuck and run, fuck and run, even when I was seventeen
         D2            A2   Bm              G2
Fuck and run, fuck and run, even when I was twelve

D               A    F#m                    G
You almost felt bad, you said that I should call you up
    D2                      A2       Bm                 G
But I knew much better than that and almost immediately I felt sorry
