Dm                                                               Bb
Interstate, the windows down, And the air outside it smells like burn
Dm                                                       Bb
Quiet streets, the windows up, and broken glass is on the ground
Dm                                                                    Bb
Afternoon the skies light up, The air gets still, And then that siren sounds
    Dm                 Bb
And then... that siren sounds

         Bb                   C
And it's summer and you're supposed to feel happy
     Bb                   C
It's summer and you're supposed to feel happy
         Bb               C
And it's summer you're supposed to feel

            F                   Bb    C
I just want peace in the Middle West
             F                 Bb    C
Don't give a damn bout all the rest
     F                                      Bb         C             F Bb C
Want burned-up air and broke down panes and siren's cry to be in jest

         Bb                   C
And it's summer and you're supposed to feel happy
     Bb                   C
It's summer and you're supposed to feel happy
         Bb               C
And it's summer you're supposed to feel

     F     Bb     C          F                  Bb    C
I just want peace in the Middle West

Don't give two shits bout all the rest
     F
Want tall stiff drinks, and silent meals
    Bb             C                               F    Bb C
And shoulders broad and Great Lake strips to be in jest

Dm                                                                              Bb
Humid nights, The sheets pulled back, In still, hot air the tattered flag hangs slack
Dm                                                            Bb
Alleys dark, The screen door torn, The corner piled high with bricks

         Bb                   C
And it's summer and you're supposed to feel happy
     Bb                   C
It's summer and you're supposed to feel happy
         Bb               C
And it's summer you're supposed to feel

Bb C          Bb C          Bb C         F
No blood for, No blood for, No blood for mayo
