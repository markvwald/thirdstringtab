You might let anybody see your underwear
D                                     C  G
But you won't let just anybody have a go
D                                         C                  G
You had me hoping maybe baby that I would get to get in there

And all I got for you is a loud song
All I got for you is a loud song

Chaos lurks just right behind your smile
D                                               C             G

'Cause all I got for you is a loud song
