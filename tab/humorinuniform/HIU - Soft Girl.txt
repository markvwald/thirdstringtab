soft girl did her worst and got the best of me
Em                      A
i fell in love with her lack of personality
C                D                 Em             A
not that she was dull, but she had nothing in her skull
    C                 D                        G

soft girl wrecked me bad and now i got it good
Em                A
her childish ways took me like she knew they would
C                D                 Em             A
not that she was lame, but she had nothing in her brain
    C                    D                   G
now this hard boy is the joke of the neighborhood

don't have to worry 'bout my dignity no more
C         D            G
it wasn't me it was my cowboy boots
       (break)       C
that broke down your door
         D      Em            A
now it's winter, my heart's a splinter
C                 D                G

Soft Girl set me right and then she done me wrong
Em                                 A
Hates my cat, hates my guts, She's really gonna hate this song
    C            D                Em               A
i'm trying to forget her, but i'd rather just stay bitter
        C                D                      G
Now I'm face down in the gutter right where I belong
